"Introduction: Colorectal cancer has a high prevalence and mortality rate in the 
United Kingdom. Cancerous colorectal lesions often bleed into the 
gastrointestinal lumen. The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) detects haemoglobin 
(Hb) in the faeces of patients and is used as a first line test in the diagnosis 
of colorectal cancer. Materials and Methods: A retrospective audit of all FIT 
performed and all colorectal cancers diagnosed in the Hull and East Riding of 
Yorkshire counties of the United Kingdom (population approximately 609,300) 
between 2018 and 2022 was conducted. FIT were performed using a HM-JACKarc 
analyser from Kyowa medical. The predominant symptom suggestive of colorectal 
cancer which prompted the FIT was recorded. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed 
using the gold standard of histological biopsy following colonoscopy. Results: 
Between 2018 and 2022, 56,202 FIT were performed on symptomatic patients. Follow 
on testing identified 1,511 with colorectal cancer. Of these people, only 450 
people with a confirmed colorectal cancer had a FIT within the 12 months 
preceding their diagnosis. Of these 450 FIT results, 36 had a concentration of 
<10 μg/g and may be considered to be a false negative. The sensitivity of FIT in 
the patients identified was 92.00%. The most common reason stated by the 
clinician for a FIT being performed in patients with colorectal cancer was a 
change in bowel habits, followed by iron deficient anaemia. The number of 
patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer decreased in 2020, but increased 
significantly in 2021. Discussion: This study shows that 8.00% of people 
diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire 
regions had a negative FIT. This study also shows that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
affected the number of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and therefore 
skews the prevalence and pre-test probability of a positive test. There are many 
reasons why a FIT could produce a false negative result, the most likely being 
biological factors affecting the stability of haemoglobin within the 
gastrointestinal tract, or pre-analytical factors influencing faecal sampling 
preventing the detection of haemoglobin. Some colorectal lesions do not protrude 
into the gastrointestinal lumen and are less likely to bleed. Conclusion: This 
is the first study showing data from outside of a structured clinical trial and 
provides the largest study to date showing the sensitivity of FIT in a routine 
clinical setting. This study also provides evidence for the impact COVID-19 had 
on the rate of colorectal cancer diagnosis."

"BACKGROUND: We determined the impact of an increased two-stool faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) cut-off on colonoscopy positivity and relative 
sensitivity and specificity in the randomized controlled screening trial 
screening of Swedish colons conducted in Sweden.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the FIT arm 
that performed FIT between March 2014 and 2020 within the study registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02078804, who had a faecal haemoglobin concentration of 
at least 10 µg/g in at least one of two stool samples and who underwent a 
colonoscopy (n = 3841). For each increase in cut-off, we computed the positive 
predictive value (PPV), numbers needed to scope (NNS), sensitivity and 
specificity for finding colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced neoplasia (AN; 
advanced adenoma or CRC) relative to cut-off 10 µg/g.
RESULTS: The PPV for AN increased from 23.0% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 
22.3%-23.6%) at cut-off 10 µg/g to 28.8% (95% CI: 27.8%-29.7%) and 33.1% (95% 
CI: 31.9%-34.4%) at cut-offs 20 and 40 µg/g, respectively, whereas the NNS to 
find a CRC correspondingly decreased from 41 to 27 and 19. The PPV for AN was 
higher in men than women at each cut-off, for example 31.5% (95% CI: 
30.1%-32.8%) in men and 25.6% (95% CI: 24.3%-27.0%) in women at 20 µg/g. The 
relative sensitivity and relative specificity were similar in men and women at 
each cut-off.
CONCLUSION: A low cut-off of around 20-40 µg/g allows detection and removal of 
many AN compared to 10 µg/g while reducing the number of colonoscopies in both 
men and women."

"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in the uptake of colorectal cancer 
screening are well documented, but the implications on inequities in health gain 
remain unclear.
METHODS: Sixty-year-olds were randomly recruited from the Swedish population 
between March 2014 and March 2020 and invited to undergo either 2 rounds of 
fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) 2 years apart (n = 60 137) or primary 
colonoscopy just once (n = 30 400). By linkage to Statistics Sweden's 
registries, we obtained socioeconomic data. In each defined socioeconomic group, 
we estimated the cumulative yield of advanced neoplasia in each screening arm 
(intention-to-screen analysis). In the biennial FIT arm, we predicted the 
probability of exceeding the yield in the primary colonoscopy arm by linear 
extrapolation of the cumulative yield to (hypothetical) additional rounds of 
FIT.
RESULTS: In the lowest income group, the yield of advanced neoplasia was 1.63% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35% to 1.93%) after 2 rounds of FIT vs 1.93% 
(95% CI = 1.49% to 2.40%) in the primary colonoscopy arm. Extrapolation to a 
third round of FIT implied a 86% probability of exceeding the yield in the 
primary colonoscopy arm. In the highest income group, we found a more pronounced 
yield gap between the 2 screening strategies-2.32% (95% CI = 2.15% to 2.49%) vs 
3.71% (95% CI = 3.41% to 4.02%)- implying a low (2%) predicted probability of 
exceeding yield after a third round of FIT.
CONCLUSIONS: Yield of advanced neoplasia from 2 rounds of FIT 2 years apart was 
poorer as compared with primary colonoscopy, but the difference was less in 
lower socioeconomic groups.

"IMPORTANCE: Noninvasive tests for colorectal cancer screening must include 
sensitive detection of colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions. These tests 
must be validated for the intended-use population, which includes average-risk 
individuals 45 years or older.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a noninvasive, 
multitarget stool RNA (mt-sRNA) test (ColoSense) test compared with results from 
a colonoscopy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 3 clinical trial (CRC-PREVENT) was 
a blinded, prospective, cross-sectional study to support a premarket approval 
application for a class III medical device. A total of 8920 participants were 
identified online using social media platforms and enrolled from June 2021 to 
June 2022 using a decentralized nurse call center. All participants completed 
the mt-sRNA test, which incorporated a commercially available fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT), concentration of 8 RNA transcripts, and 
participant-reported smoking status. Stool samples were collected prior to 
participants completing a colonoscopy at their local endoscopy center. The 
mt-sRNA test results (positive or negative) were compared with index lesions 
observed on colonoscopy. Over the course of 12 months, individuals 45 years and 
older were enrolled in the clinical trial using the decentralized recruitment 
strategy. Participants were enrolled from 49 US states and obtained 
colonoscopies at more than 3800 different endoscopy centers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes included the sensitivity of the 
mt-sRNA test for detecting colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas and the 
specificity for no lesions on colonoscopy.
RESULTS: The mean (range) age of participants was 55 (45-90) years, with 4% 
self-identified as Asian, 11% as Black, and 7% as Hispanic. Of the 8920 eligible 
participants, 36 (0.40%) had colorectal cancer and 606 (6.8%) had advanced 
adenomas. The mt-sRNA test sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer was 94%, 
sensitivity for detecting advanced adenomas was 46%, and specificity for no 
lesions on colonoscopy was 88%. The mt-sRNA test showed significant improvement 
in sensitivity for colorectal cancer (94% vs 78%; McNemar P = .01) and advanced 
adenomas (46% vs 29%; McNemar P < .001) compared with results of the FIT.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In individuals 45 years and older, the mt-sRNA test 
showed high sensitivity for colorectal neoplasia (colorectal cancer and advanced 
adenoma) with significant improvement in sensitivity relative to the FIT. 
Specificity for no lesions on colonoscopy was comparable to existing molecular 
diagnostic tests.

"IMPORTANCE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces CRC mortality; however, 
screening rates remain well below the national benchmark of 80%.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an electronic primer message delivered through 
the patient portal increases the completion rate of CRC screening in a mailed 
fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach program.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized clinical quality 
improvement trial at the University of California, Los Angeles Health of 2339 
patients enrolled in a FIT mailing program from August 28, 2019, to September 
20, 2020, patients were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention 
group, and the screening completion rate was measured at 6 months. Participants 
were average-risk managed care patients aged 50 to 75 years, with a valid 
mailing address, no mailed CRC outreach in the previous 6 months, and an active 
electronic health record (EHR) patient portal who were due for CRC screening. 
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either (1) 
the standard FIT mailed outreach (control group) or (2) the standard FIT mailed 
outreach plus an automated primer to notify patients of the upcoming mailed FIT 
sent through the electronic patient portal (intervention group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the screening completion 
rate (ie, returning the FIT). Secondary outcomes were (1) were the time to CRC 
screening from the FIT mailing date, (2) screening modality completed, and (3) 
the effect of opening the electronic primer on screening completion rate.
RESULTS: The study included 2339 patients (1346 women [57.5%]; mean [SD] age, 
58.9 [7.5] years). The screening completion rate was higher in the intervention 
group than in the control group (37.6% [445 of 1182] vs 32.1% [371 of 1157]; 
P = .005). The time to screening was shorter in the intervention group than in 
the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42; P = .003). 
The proportion of each screening test modality completed was similar in both 
groups. In a subanalysis of the 900 of 1182 patients (76.1%) in the intervention 
group who opened the patient portal primer message, there was a 7.3-percentage 
point (95% CI, 2.3-12.4 percentage points) increase in CRC screening (local mean 
treatment effect; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Implementation of an electronic patient portal primer 
message in a mailed FIT outreach program led to a significant increase in CRC 
screening and improvement in the time to screening completion. The findings 
provide an evidence base for additional refinements to mailed FIT outreach 
quality improvement programs in large health systems.

"Regulatory T cells are essential players of peripheral tolerance and suppression 
of inflammatory immune responses. Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are FoxP3- 
regulatory T cells induced in the periphery under tolerogenic conditions. Tr1 
cells are identified as LAG3+CD49b+ mature CD4+ T cells that promote peripheral 
tolerance through secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β in addition to exerting perforin- 
and granzyme B-mediated cytotoxicity against myeloid cells. After the initial 
challenges of isolation were overcome by surface marker identification, ex vivo 
expansion of antigen-specific Tr1 cells in the presence of tolerogenic dendritic 
cells (DCs) and IL-10 paved the way for their use in clinical trials. With one 
Tr1-enriched cell therapy product already in a Phase I clinical trial in the 
context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), Tr1 
cell therapy demonstrates promising results so far in terms of efficacy and 
safety. In the current review, we identify developments in phenotypic and 
molecular characterization of Tr1 cells and discuss the potential of engineered 
Tr1-like cells for clinical applications of Tr1 cell therapies. More than 3 
decades after their initial discovery, Tr1 cell therapy is now being used to 
prevent graft versus host disease (GvHD) in allo-HSCT and will be an alternative 
to immunosuppression to promote graft tolerance in solid organ transplantation 
in the near future."

"INTRODUCTION: Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 for the 
treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. The aim of the current study was to 
present a predesigned interim analysis of the data of patients who have 
completed 1 year of therapy with mepolizumab.
METHODS: This study is a prospective multicenter, noninterventional 2-year 
observational study and aims to describe the clinical benefit and safety profile 
of mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.
RESULTS: Compared to the year preceding the initiation of treatment, the annual 
rate of exacerbations decreased significantly, from 4.3 ± 2.3 to 1.3 ± 1.8; p < 
0.0001. Forty-two patients received maintenance dose of oral corticosteroids 
(OCS) at baseline. From these patients at the end of 1 year of therapy with 
mepolizumab, 17 patients (40%) had achieved OCS discontinuation. A reduction in 
the median dose of OCS was also achieved. After 1 year of treatment with 
mepolizumab, the asthma control test score significantly increased from 16.3 ± 
3.7 to 21.2 ± 3.8 (p < 0.0001). This marked clinical improvement was paralleled 
by a significant reduction of blood eosinophil count. All patients showed a 
considerable improvement of airflow limitation. In respect to adverse events of 
treatment with mepolizumab, 19 patients (27%) were recorded to have at least one 
such occurrence during their 1-year treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, 1 
year of treatment with mepolizumab was safe, resulted in significant reduction 
of the annual exacerbation rate, reduction (or even discontinuation) of the

"The COVID-19 pandemic has surprised the entire population. The world has had to 
face an unprecedented pandemic. Only, Spanish flu had similar disastrous 
consequences. As a result, drastic measures (lockdown) have been adopted 
worldwide. Healthcare service has been overwhelmed by the extraordinary influx 
of patients, often requiring high intensity of care. Mortality has been 
associated with severe comorbidities, including chronic diseases. Patients with 
frailty were, therefore, the victim of the SARS-COV-2 infection. Allergy and 
asthma are the most prevalent chronic disorders in children and adolescents, so 
they need careful attention and, if necessary, an adaptation of their regular 
treatment plans. Fortunately, at present, young people are less suffering from 
COVID-19, both as incidence and severity. However, any age, including infancy, 
could be affected by the pandemic.Based on this background, the Italian Society 
of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology has felt it necessary to provide a Consensus 
Statement. This expert panel consensus document offers a rationale to help guide 
decision-making in the management of children and adolescents with allergic or 
immunologic diseases."

"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health threat. Although a vaccine has been 
available for almost 100 years termed Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), it is 
insufficient and better vaccines are urgently needed. This treatise describes 
first the basic immunology and pathology of TB with an emphasis on the role of T 
lymphocytes. Better understanding of the immune response to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) serves as blueprint for rational design of TB vaccines. Then, 
disease epidemiology and the benefits and failures of BCG vaccination will be 
presented. Next, types of novel vaccine candidates are being discussed. These 
include: (i) antigen/adjuvant subunit vaccines; (ii) viral vectored vaccines; 
and (III) whole cell mycobacterial vaccines which come as live recombinant 
vaccines or as dead whole cell or multi-component vaccines. Subsequently, the 
major endpoints of clinical trials as well as administration schemes are being 
described. Major endpoints for clinical trials are prevention of infection 
(PoI), prevention of disease (PoD), and prevention of recurrence (PoR). Vaccines 
can be administered either pre-exposure or post-exposure with Mtb. A central 
part of this treatise is the description of the viable BCG-based vaccine, 
VPM1002, currently undergoing phase III clinical trial assessment. Finally, new 
approaches which could facilitate design of refined next generation TB vaccines 
will be discussed."

"Objectives. To compare usual care, inreach consisting of one-on-one education, 
mailed outreach offering a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and a combination of 
outreach and inreach for promoting colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.Methods. We 
conducted a 4-arm randomized controlled trial from 2015 to 2018 at a US 
federally qualified health center near the California-Mexico border primarily 
serving low-income Hispanics/Latinos. A total of 673 individuals aged 50 to 75 
years not up to date with screening were assigned to 1 of the 4 intervention 
groups. The primary outcome was CRC screening through 6 months 
follow-up.Results. A total of 671 patients were included in intention-to-screen 
analyses. Their mean age was 59.9 years, 48.9% were male, and 86.3% were 
primarily Spanish-speaking. Screening was 27.5% for usual care (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.21, 0.34), 52.7% for inreach (95% CI = 0.45, 0.60), 77.2% for 
outreach (95% CI = 0.71, 0.83), and 78.9% for combination of inreach and 
outreach (95% CI = 0.73, 0.85; P < .001 for all comparisons except P = .793 for 
outreach vs combination).Conclusions. Among individuals at high risk for 
noncompletion, inreach with one-on-one education nearly doubled, and outreach 
offering mailed FIT alone or in combination with inreach nearly tripled 
screening compared with usual care. Mailed FIT outreach was superior to inreach 
for promoting screening."

"The goal of this study was to explore diagnostic colonoscopy completion in 
adults with abnormal screening fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results. This was 
a secondary analysis of the Strategies and Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in 
Priority Populations (Stop CRC) study, a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial to 
increase uptake of CRC screening in federally qualified community health 
clinics. Diagnostic colonoscopy completion and reasons for non-completion were 
ascertained through a manual review of electronic health records, and completion 
was compared across a wide range of individual patient health and 
sociodemographic characteristics. Among 2,018 adults with an abnormal FIT 
result, 1066 (52.8%) completed a follow-up colonoscopy within 12 months. 
Completion was generally similar across a wide range of participant 
subpopulations; however, completion was higher for participants who were 
younger, Hispanic, Spanish-speaking, and had zero or one of the Charlson medical 
comorbidities, compared to their counterparts. Neighborhood-level predictors 
were not associated with diagnostic colonoscopy completion. Thus, completion of 
a diagnostic colonoscopy was relatively low in a large sample of community 
health clinic adults who had an abnormal screening FIT result. While completion 
was generally similar across a wide range of characteristics, younger, 
healthier, Hispanic participants tended to have a higher likelihood of 
completion."

"Given the critical role that the immune system plays in a multitude of diseases, 
having a clear understanding of the pharmacology of the immune system is crucial 
to new drug discovery and development. Here we describe the International Union 
of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Guide to Immunopharmacology 
(GtoImmuPdb), which connects expert-curated pharmacology with key immunological 
concepts and aims to put pharmacological data into the hands of immunologists. 
In the pursuit of new therapeutics, pharmacological databases are a vital 
resource to researchers through providing accurate information on the 
fundamental science underlying drug action. This extension to the existing 
IUPHAR/British Pharmacological Society Guide to Pharmacology supports research 
into the development of drugs targeted at modulating immune, inflammatory or 
infectious components of disease. To provide a deeper context for how the 
resource can support research we show data in GtoImmuPdb relating to a case 
study on the targeting of vascular inflammation."

"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related 
morbidity and mortality in the United States. Although various interventions 
have improved screening rates, they often require abundant resources and can be 
difficult to implement. Social psychology and behavioral economics principles 
offer an opportunity for low-cost and easy-to-implement strategies but are less 
common in clinical settings.
METHODS: We randomized 2,000 patients aged 50-75 years eligible for CRC 
screening to one of the 2 mailed interventions: a previously used text-based 
letter describing and offering fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and 
colonoscopy (usual care arm); or a letter leveraging social psychology and 
behavioral economics principles (e.g., implied scarcity and choice 
architecture), minimal text, and multiple images to offer FIT and colonoscopy 
(intervention arm). We compared total screening uptake, FIT uptake, and 
colonoscopy uptake at 1-month intervals in each group.
RESULTS: There were 1,882 patients included in the final analysis. The mean age 
was 69.3 years, and baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were similar. 
Screening completion at 26 weeks was 19.5% in the usual care arm (16.3% FIT vs 
3.2% colonoscopy, P < 0.01) and 24.1% in the intervention arm (22.1% FIT vs 2.0% 
colonoscopy, P < 0.01) (P = 0.02).
DISCUSSION: Among primary care patients aged 50-75 years in an academic setting, 
mailed CRC outreach employing social psychology and behavioral economics 
principles led to a higher participation in CRC screening than usual care mailed 
outreach.
TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT: Mailed interventions to increase CRC screening should 
incorporate social psychology and behavioral economics principles to improve 
participation."

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The introduction of high-quality and standardized extracts 
for immunotherapy has renewed the interest in the treatment of pediatric 
allergic asthma that represents a high-prevalence disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to clinical trials, several systematic reviews and 
metaanalyses were published, confirming overall the clinical efficacy of 
allergen immunotherapy in pediatric asthma. In addition, new data on the 
preventive effect of the treatment on asthma onset were published. Despite this, 
many intriguing questions emerged, in parallel to the development of knowledge.
SUMMARY: Allergen immunotherapy is overall effective for the treatment of asthma 
in children, but a class-effect should not be claimed, rather the efficacy of 
each single product. According to the recent findings, the challenge for the 
future research will be to clarify: when to start immunotherapy in children, 
which are (if they exist) the predictive biomarkers for efficacy in the single 
individual, the magnitude of the preventive effect and the optimal duration of 
the treatment."

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy are the 
most commonly used strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening worldwide. 
We aimed to compare their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in CRC screening in an 
average-risk population.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and National Health Services Economic Evaluation 
Database were searched. Risk ratio (RR) was used to evaluate the differences in 
detection rates of colorectal neoplasia between FIT and colonoscopy groups. A 
random-effects model was used to pool RRs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) were calculated to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FIT versus 
colonoscopy.
RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials and 17 cost-effectiveness studies were 
included. The participation rate in the FIT group was higher than that in the 
colonoscopy group (41.6% vs 21.9%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, FIT had 
a detection rate of CRC comparable with colonoscopy (RR, .73; 95% confidence 
interval, .37-1.42) and lower detection rates of any adenoma and advanced 
adenoma than 1-time colonoscopy. Most included cost-effectiveness studies showed 
that annual (13/15) or biennial (5/6) FIT was cost-saving (ICER < $0) or very 
cost-effective ($0 < ICER ≤ $25000/quality-adjusted life-year) compared with 
colonoscopy every 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: FIT may be similar to 1-time colonoscopy in the detection rate of 
CRC, although it has lower detection rates of any adenoma and advanced adenoma 
than 1-time colonoscopy. Furthermore, annual or biennial FIT appears to be very 
cost-effective or cost-saving compared with colonoscopy every 10 years. These 
findings indicate, at least partly, that FIT is noninferior to colonoscopy in 
CRC screening in an average-risk population. Our findings should be treated with 
caution and need to be further confirmed."

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Second-generation colon capsule endoscopy (CCE-2) has shown 
promising accuracy for the diagnosis of overall neoplasia. Advanced neoplasia 
(AN) represents the main target of colorectal cancer screening programs. Our aim 
was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CCE-2 for the detection of AN in 
patients with a positive result for the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) who are 
undergoing screening.
METHODS: Patients aged 50 to 69 years with a positive result for the FIT in 4 
population screening programs in Italy and Spain were enrolled. Screenees were 
asked to undergo CCE-2, followed by traditional colonoscopy (TC). TC was 
performed the same day or the following morning. Bowel preparation included a 
split-dose polyethylene glycol-based regimen, with sodium phosphate (NaP) with 
gastrografin as boosters. The CCE-2 video was read by an endoscopist blinded to 
the results of TC. The main outcomes were CCE-2 accuracy in terms of 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV) for AN when using 2 different size thresholds for TC 
referral (ie, polyps ≥6 mm and ≥10 mm).
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled, and 178 patients 
completed both CCE-2 and TC (87.7%). Overall, 59 cases of AN were detected at 
TC. CCE-2 sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 66.1%, PPV was 57.4%, and NPV was 
92.9% for AN when using a 6-mm cut-off (TC referral rate, 52.8%) and 76.7%, 
90.7%, 80.7%, and 88.4% when using a 10-mm cut-off (TC referral rate, 32%), 
respectively. CCE-2 detected that 8 of 9 already developed colorectal cancers. 
Among the 41 false positives at the 6-mm cut-off, 34 (82.9%) presented with a 
nonadvanced adenoma at TC. Mean transit time was 4 hours and 4 minutes, and ≥70% 
of patients excreted the capsule within 5 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: In an enriched disease setting, we showed the high sensitivity of 
CCE-2 for the diagnosis of AN at a 6-mm cut-off. The apparently low CCE-2 
specificity is related to the choice of AN as the main outcome. (Clinical trial 
registration number: ISRCTN 62158762.)."

"BACKGROUND: Female physicians are significantly less likely than male physicians 
to be full professors, even after accounting for age, experience, specialty, and 
measures of research and clinical productivity.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate sex differences in academic rank in the allergy 
and immunology workforce.
METHODS: We used a cross-sectional physician data set containing the allergist's 
sex, age, years since residency, faculty appointment, authored publications, 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, clinical trial investigation, and 
Medicare reimbursement to investigate sex differences in the academic allergy 
and immunology workforce using multilevel logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Among 507 academic allergists (9.3% of practicing US allergists in 
2014), 323 (63.7%) were men, and 184 (36.3%) were women. Female allergists were 
younger (47.9 vs 56.9 years, P < .001), had fewer total (12.5 vs 28.7, P < .001) 
and first/last author (8.0 vs 21.5, P < .001) average publications, were less 
likely to have NIH funding (13.0% vs 23.5%, P = .004), were less frequently a 
clinical trial investigator (10.3% vs 16.1%, P = .07), and generated less 
average annual Medicare revenue ($44,000 vs $23,000, P = .10). Of 152 (30.0%) 
full professors, 126 (82.9%) were male, and 26 (17.0%) were female. After 
multivariable adjustment, rates of full professorship among female and male 
allergists were not significantly different (absolute adjusted difference for 
female vs male allergists, 6.0%; 95% CI, -8.3% to 20.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among allergists with US medical school faculty appointments, men 
and women were similarly likely to be full professors after accounting for 
factors influencing promotion. Underlying differences in research productivity 
and NIH funding not explained by age differences alone warrant additional 
investigation."

"Mailed outreach promoting colorectal cancer (CRC) screening with a stool blood 
test kit may increase participation, but magnitude and consistency of benefit of 
this intervention strategy is uncertain. Our aim was to conduct a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mailed 
outreach offering stool tests to usual care, clinic-based screening offers on 
CRC screening uptake in the USA. We performed a systematic literature search of 
five databases for RCTs of mailed outreach from January 1980 through June 2017. 
Primary outcome was screening completion, summarized using random-effects 
meta-analysis as pooled differences in proportion completing the screening and 
relative risk of achieving screening compared to control. Subgroup analyses by 
test type offered-fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or guaiac fecal occult blood 
test (gFOBT), the presence of telephone reminders, and the presence of 
predominant underserved/minority population within study were performed. Quality 
of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Seven RCTs which enrolled 
12,501 subjects were included (n = 5703 assigned mailed outreach and n = 6798 
usual care). Mailed outreach resulted in a 28% absolute (95% CI 25-30%; 
I2 = 47%) and a 2.8-fold relative (RR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03-3.45; I2 = 92%) increase 
in screening completion compared to usual care, with a number needed to invite 
estimated to be 3.6. Similar outcomes were observed across subgroups. Overall 
body of evidence was at moderate quality. Mailed outreach offering a gFOBT or 
FIT is associated with a large and consistent increase in CRC screening 
completion and should be considered for more widespread implementation for 
improving screening rates nationwide."

"Objectives: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is used in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening, but evaluations of multiple sample strategies in colonoscopy 
screening cohorts are rare. The aim of this study was to assess accuracy of FIT 
for advanced neoplasia (AN) with two fecal samples in a colonoscopy screening 
cohort. Materials and methods: The study comprised 1155 participants of the 
colonoscopy arm in SCREESCO (Screening of Swedish Colons, NCT02078804), a 
randomized controlled study on CRC screening of 60-year-olds from the Swedish 
average-risk population. Participants provided two FIT samples prior to 
colonoscopy. First sample, mean of two, and any of the two samples above cut off 
level were assessed. Colonoscopy findings (CRC, advanced adenoma (AA), AN 
(CRC + AA) and adenoma characteristics) were evaluated in uni- and multivariable 
analysis in relation to FIT positivity (at ≥10 µg hemoglobin (Hb)/g). Results: 
Of 1155 invited, 806 (416 women, 390 men) participated. CRC, AA and non-AA were 
found in one (0.1%), 80 (9.9%) and 145 (18%), respectively. Sensitivity and 
specificity for AN were 20%/93%, 25%/92% and 26%/89% for first, mean of two and 
any of the two samples respectively at cut off level 10 µg/g, corresponding to 
60 (74%)-65 (80%) participants with missed AN. The difference in sensitivity 
between screening strategies was non-significant. The specificity for first 
sample was significantly higher than for any of the two samples at cut off 
10 µg/g (p = .02) and 20 µg/g (p = .04). FIT positivity in participants with 
adenoma was associated with pedunculated shape (p = .007) and high-risk 
dysplasia (p = .009). Conclusions: In an average-risk colonoscopy screening 
cohort of 60-year-olds, sensitivity for AN was modest and did not increase when 
using two samples instead of one. FIT predominantly detected adenomas with 
pedunculated shape and high-risk dysplasia, and participants with flat or broad 
based adenomas may thus be missed in screening."

"INTRODUCTION: The impact of fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal 
cancer (CRC) screening on disease incidence and mortality is affected by 
participation, which might be influenced by ease of use of the FIT. We compared 
the participation rates and ease of use of 2 different FITs in a CRC screening 
program.
METHODS: There were two study designs within the Dutch CRC screening program. In 
a paired cohort study, all invitees received 2 FITs (OC-Sensor, Eiken, Japan, 
and FOB-Gold, Sentinel, Italy) and were asked to sample both from the same 
stool. Ease of use of both FITs was evaluated by a questionnaire. In a 
randomized controlled trial, invitees were randomly allocated to receive one of 
the 2 FITs to compare participation and analyzability.
RESULTS: Of 42,179 invitees in the paired cohort study, 21,078 (50%) completed 2 
tests and 20,727 (98%) returned the questionnaire. FOB-Gold was reported 
significantly easier to use. More participants preferred FOB-Gold (36%) than 
OC-Sensor (5%), yet most had no preference (59%; P < 0.001). In the randomized 
trial, 936 of 1,923 invitees (48.7%) returned the FOB-Gold and 940 of 1,923 
invitees (48.9%) returned the OC-Sensor, a difference of -0.2% (confidence 
interval, -3.4% to 3.0%), well within the pre-specified 5% noninferiority margin 
(P = 0.001). Only one FOB-Gold (0.1%) and 4 OC-Sensors (0.4%) were not 
analyzable (P = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: Although FOB-Gold was significantly but marginally considered 
easier to use than OC-Sensor, the number of analyzable tests and the 
participation rates in organized CRC screening are not affected when either of 
the FITs is implemented as a primary screening test."

"BACKGROUND: In the UK, patients with one or two adenomas, of which at least one 
is ≥ 10 mm in size, or three or four small adenomas, are deemed to be at 
intermediate risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and referred for surveillance 
colonoscopy 3 years post polypectomy. However, colonoscopy is costly, can cause 
discomfort and carries a small risk of complications.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not annual faecal immunochemical tests 
(FITs) are effective, acceptable and cost saving compared with colonoscopy 
surveillance for detecting CRC and advanced adenomas (AAs).
DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study with health psychology assessment and economic 
evaluation.
SETTING: Participants were recruited from 30 January 2012 to 30 December 2013 
within the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Men and women, aged 60-72 years, deemed to be at intermediate risk 
of CRC following adenoma removal after a positive guaiac faecal occult blood 
test were invited to participate. Invitees who consented and returned an 
analysable FIT were included.
INTERVENTION: We offered participants quantitative FITs at 1, 2 and 3 years post 
polypectomy. Participants testing positive with any FIT were referred for 
colonoscopy and not offered further FITs. Participants testing negative were 
offered colonoscopy at 3 years post polypectomy. Acceptibility of FIT was 
assessed using discussion groups, questionnaires and interviews.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 3-year sensitivity of an annual 
FIT versus colonoscopy at 3 years for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasia 
(ACN) (CRC and/or AA). Secondary outcomes included participants' surveillance 
preferences, and the incremental costs and cost-effectiveness of FIT versus 
colonoscopy surveillance.
RESULTS: Of 8008 invitees, 5946 (74.3%) consented and returned a round 1 FIT. 
FIT uptake in rounds 2 and 3 was 97.2% and 96.9%, respectively. With a threshold 
of 40 µg of haemoglobin (Hb)/g faeces (hereafter referred to as µg/g), 
positivity was 5.8% in round 1, declining to 4.1% in round 3. Over three rounds, 
69.2% (18/26) of participants with CRC, 34.3% (152/443) with AAs and 35.6% 
(165/463) with ACN tested positive at 40 µg/g. Sensitivity for CRC and AAs 
increased, whereas specificity decreased, with lower thresholds and multiple 
rounds. At 40 µg/g, sensitivity and specificity of the first FIT for CRC were 
30.8% and 93.9%, respectively. The programme sensitivity and specificity of 
three rounds at 10 µg/g were 84.6% and 70.8%, respectively. Participants' 
preferred surveillance strategy was 3-yearly colonoscopy plus annual FITs 
(57.9%), followed by annual FITs with colonoscopy in positive cases (31.5%). FIT 
with colonoscopy in positive cases was cheaper than 3-yearly colonoscopy 
(£2,633,382), varying from £485,236 (40 µg/g) to £956,602 (10 µg/g). Over 3 
years, FIT surveillance could miss 291 AAs and eight CRCs using a threshold of 
40 µg/g, or 189 AAs and four CRCs using a threshold of 10 µg/g.
CONCLUSIONS: Annual low-threshold FIT with colonoscopy in positive cases 
achieved high sensitivity for CRC and would be cost saving compared with 
3-yearly colonoscopy. However, at higher thresholds, this strategy could miss 
15-30% of CRCs and 40-70% of AAs. Most participants preferred annual FITs plus 
3-yearly colonoscopy. Further research is needed to define a clear role for FITs 
in surveillance.
FUTURE WORK: Evaluate the impact of ACN missed by FITs on quality-adjusted 
life-years.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal flat (nonpolypoid) lesions can be overlooked 
during colonoscopy. This study evaluated the efficacy of updated 
autofluorescence imaging (AFI) for detecting colorectal flat neoplasms.
METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 9 
Japanese tertiary institutions. Patients undergoing colonoscopy because of 
positive fecal immunochemical tests, surveillance after polypectomy, or 
investigation of minor symptoms were enrolled and randomly assigned to either 
the white-light imaging (WLI) or the AFI group. Primary outcome measurement was 
number of flat neoplasms per patient.
RESULTS: From November 2015 to June 2017, 817 patients were enrolled. After 
excluding 15 patients, 802 were finally analyzed (404, WLI; 398, AFI). Patients' 
backgrounds (sex, age, indication of colonoscopy, experience of endoscopists) 
and quality of colonoscopy (bowel preparation, sedative use, cecal insertion 
rate, insertion and withdrawal time) were not different between groups. Number 
of flat neoplasms in each patient was significantly higher in the AFI than in 
the WLI group (.87 [95% confidence interval [CI], .78-.97] vs .53 [95% CI, 
.46-.61]), whereas overall and polypoid neoplasm detection was not significantly 
different between the groups (1.33 [95% CI, 1.22-1.45] vs 1.14 [95% CI, 
1.03-1.24], .46 [95% CI, .40-.53] vs .60 [95% CI, .53-.68]). Flat neoplasms were 
more frequently detected in the right-sided colon with AFI (.61 [95% CI, 
.54-.70] vs .30 [95% CI, .25-.36]) but not in the left-sided colon and rectum 
(.26 [95% CI, .21-.32] vs .23 [95% CI, .19-.28]).
CONCLUSIONS: Updated AFI improves the detection of flat colorectal neoplasms in 
the right-sided colon compared with WLI. (Clinical trial registration number:

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The EndoRings add-on has been claimed to improve adenoma 
detection at colonoscopy, but available data are inconsistent. When testing a 
new technology, parallel and crossover methodologies measure different outcomes, 
leaving uncertainty about their correspondence. The aims of this study were to 
compare the diagnostic yield and miss rate of the EndoRings for colorectal 
neoplasia.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy after a positive fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) within an organized screening program in 7 Italian 
centers were randomized between a parallel (EndoRings or standard) or a 
crossover (EndoRings/standard or standard/EndoRings) methodology. Outcomes 
measures were the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and advanced adenoma detection 
rate (AADR) in the parallel arms and the miss rate of adenomas in the crossover 
arms.
RESULTS: Of 958 eligible patients, 927 (317 EndoRings; 317 standard; 142 
EndoRings/standard; 151 standard/Endo-Rings) were included in the final 
analysis. In the parallel arms (mean ADR, 51.3%; mean AADR, 25.4%), no 
difference between standard and EndoRings was found for both ADR (relative risk 
[RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28) and AADR (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 
0.88-1.51), as well as for the mean number of adenomas and advanced adenomas per 
patient (EndoRings, 1.9 ± 1.3 and 1.0 ± 1.2; standard, 2.1 ± 1.5 and 1.0 ± 1.2; 
P = not significant for both comparisons). In the crossover arms, no difference 
in the miss rate for adenomas between EndoRings and standard was found at per 
polyp (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.97-2.10) or per-patient analysis (24% vs 26%; P = 
.76).
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference in diagnostic yield and 
miss rate between EndoRings and standard colonoscopy was detected in patients 
with a positive FIT result. A clinically relevant correspondence between miss 
and detection rates was shown, supporting a cause-effect relationship. (ISRCTN 
registry: ISRCTN10357435.)."

"Circulating cell free tumour derived nucleic acids are becoming recognised as 
clinically significant and extremely useful biomarkers for detection of cancer 
and for monitoring the progression of targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy. 
Screening programmes for colorectal cancer in Europe use the Fetal 
Immunochemical Test (FIT) test as a primary screener. FIT+ patients are referred 
to immediate colonoscopy and the positive predictive value (PPV) is usually 25%. 
In this article, we report a study employing the ColoScape assay panel to detect 
mutations in the APC, KRAS, BRAF and CTNNB1 genes, in order to collect 
preliminary performance indicators and plan a future, larger population study. 
The assay was evaluated on 52 prospectively collected whole-blood samples 
obtained from FIT+ patients enrolled in the CRC screening programme of ASL 
NAPOLI 3 SUD, using colonoscopy as confirmation. The assay's sensitivity for 
advanced adenomas was 53.8% and the specificity was 92.3%. The PPV was 70.0% and 
negative predicitive value (NPV) was 85.7%. Workflow optimisation is essential 
to maximise sensitivity. Of note, four of the six positive cases missed by 
ColoScape had a less than suboptimal DNA input (data not shown). Had they been 
ruled out as inadequate, sensitivity would have increased from 53.8% to 69%. 
However, as stated previously, this is not a clinical trial, but rather an 
initial, preliminary technical evaluation. In conclusion this study shows that 
ColoScape is a promising tool and further studies are warranted in order to 
validate its use for the triage of FIT+ patients."

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is largely preventable with routine 
screening and surveillance colonoscopy; however, interval cancers arising from 
precancerous lesions missed by standard colonoscopy still occur. An increased 
adenoma detection rate (ADR) has been found to be inversely associated with 
interval cancers. The G-EYE device includes a reusable balloon integrated at the 
distal tip of a standard colonoscope, which flattens haustral folds, centralizes 
the colonoscope's optics, and reduces bowel slippage. The insufflated balloon 
also aims to enhance visualization of the colon during withdrawal, thereby 
increasing the ADR.
METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, international, multicenter study (11 
centers), patients (aged ≥50 years) referred to colonoscopy for screening, 
surveillance, or changes in bowel habits were randomized to undergo either 
balloon-assisted colonoscopy by using an insufflated balloon during withdrawal 
or standard high-definition colonoscopy. The primary endpoint was the ADR.
RESULTS: One thousand patients were enrolled between May 2014 and September 2016 
to undergo colonoscopy by experienced endoscopists; 803 were finally analyzed 
(standard colonoscopy n = 396; balloon-assisted colonoscopy n = 407). Baseline 
parameters were similar in both groups. Balloon-assisted colonoscopy provided a 
48.0% ADR compared with 37.5% in the standard colonoscopy group (28% increase; 
P = .0027). Additionally, balloon-assisted colonoscopy provided for a 
significant increase in detection of advanced (P = .0033) flat adenomas 
(P < .0001) and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (P = .0026).
CONCLUSION: Balloon-assisted colonoscopy yielded a higher ADR and increased the 
detection of advanced, flat, and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps when compared 
with standard colonoscopy. Improved detection by the G-EYE device could impact 
the quality of CRC screening by reducing miss rates and consequently reducing 
interval cancer incidence. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT01917513.)."

"ᅟ: Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are increasingly used for 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. In our preceding observational study, 
sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms by iFOBT was 70.8% among 
users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid compared with 35.9% among non-users 
(p = 0.001), whereas there were only very small differences in specificity. In 
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve 
(AUC) was much higher for acetylsalicylic acid users than for non-users, with 
particularly strong differences in men (0.87 versus 0.68, p = 0.003). These 
findings suggested that use of acetylsalicylic acid before conduct of iFOBT 
might be a promising approach to improve non-invasive screening for CRC.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the 
diagnostic performance of two iFOBTs for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms 
after a single low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg) compared to placebo is 
evaluated. Acetylsalicylic acid or placebo is administered at least 5 days 
before a planned, study-independent colonoscopic screening in 2400 participants 
aged 40 to 80 years. Stool samples are obtained before and on three different 
days after the single dose of acetylsalicylic acid or placebo. In addition, 
optional blood samples are taken for future biomarker analyses. The diagnostic 
performance of the iFOBTs will be compared to the results of the colonoscopy as 
a gold standard for the diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. Additionally, 
gender-specific performance of the tests and gain in diagnostic performance by 
test application on multiple days will be evaluated.
DISCUSSION: If the findings from our preceding observational study will be 
confirmed in this large trial, the proposed low-risk, inexpensive intervention 
would considerably improve the diagnostic accuracy of iFOBTs and thus lead to 
enhanced early detection of colorectal neoplasms. Thus, the results of this 
trial may have a large public health impact.

"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is effective but underused. 
Screening rates are lower among Medicaid beneficiaries versus other insured 
populations. No studies have examined mailed fecal immunochemical testing 
(FIT)-based outreach programs for Medicaid beneficiaries.
METHODS: In a patient-level randomized controlled trial, a mailed CRC screening 
reminder plus FIT, sent from an urban health department to Medicaid 
beneficiaries, was compared with the same reminder without FIT. The reminder 
group could request FIT. Completed FIT kits were processed by the health 
department laboratory. Respondents were notified of normal results by mail. 
Abnormal results were given via phone by a patient navigator who provided 
counselling and assistance with follow-up care. The primary outcome was FIT 
return.
RESULTS: In all, 2144 beneficiaries at average CRC risk were identified, and 
there was no evidence of screening with Medicaid claims data. To the 
reminder+FIT group, 1071 were randomized, and 1073 were randomized to the 
reminder group; 307 (28.7%) in the reminder+FIT group and 347 (32.3%) in the 
reminder group were unreachable or ineligible (previous screening). The FIT 
return rate was significantly higher in the reminder+FIT group than the reminder 
group (21.1% vs 12.3%; difference, 8.8%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7%-13.9%; 
P < .01). Eighteen individuals (7.2%) who completed FIT tests had abnormal 
results, and 15 were eligible for follow-up colonoscopy; 66.7% (n = 10) 
completed follow-up colonoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: A health department-based, mailed FIT program targeting Medicaid 
beneficiaries was feasible. Including a FIT kit resulted in greater screening 
completion than a reminder letter alone. Further research is needed to 
understand the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions."

"Allergic diseases are on the increase globally in parallel with a decrease in 
parasitic infection. The inverse association between parasitic infections and 
allergy at an ecological level suggests a causal association. Studies in human 
subjects have generated a large knowledge base on the complexity of the 
interrelationship between parasitic infection and allergy. There is evidence for 
causal links, but the data from animal models are the most compelling: despite 
the strong type 2 immune responses they induce, helminth infections can suppress 
allergy through regulatory pathways. Conversely, many helminths can cause 
allergic-type inflammation, including symptoms of ""classical"" allergic disease. 
From an evolutionary perspective, subjects with an effective immune response 
against helminths can be more susceptible to allergy. This narrative review aims 
to inform readers of the most relevant up-to-date evidence on the relationship 
between parasites and allergy. Experiments in animal models have demonstrated 
the potential benefits of helminth infection or administration of 
helminth-derived molecules on chronic inflammatory diseases, but thus far, 
clinical trials in human subjects have not demonstrated unequivocal clinical 
benefits. Nevertheless, there is sufficiently strong evidence to support 
continued investigation of the potential benefits of helminth-derived therapies 
for the prevention or treatment of allergic and other inflammatory diseases."

"RATIONALE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is preventable through screening, with 
colonoscopy and fecal occult blood testing comprising the two most commonly used 
screening tests. Given the differences in complexity, risk, and cost, it is 
important to understand these tests' comparative effectiveness.
STUDY DESIGN: The CONFIRM Study is a large, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, 
parallel group trial to compare screening with colonoscopy vs. the annual fecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) in 50,000 average risk individuals. CONFIRM examines 
whether screening colonoscopy will be superior to a FIT-based screening program 
in the prevention of CRC mortality measured over 10 years. Eligible individuals 
50-75 years of age and due for CRC screening are recruited from 46 Veterans 
Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants are randomized to either colonoscopy 
or annual FIT. Results of colonoscopy are managed as per usual care and study 
participants are assessed for complications. Participants testing FIT positive 
are referred for colonoscopy. Participants are surveyed annually to determine if 
they have undergone colonoscopy or been diagnosed with CRC. The primary endpoint 
is CRC mortality. The secondary endpoints are (1) CRC incidence (2) 
complications of screening colonoscopy, and (3) the association between 
colonoscopists' characteristics and neoplasia detection, complications and 
post-colonoscopy CRC. CONFIRM leverages several key characteristics of the VA's 
integrated healthcare system, including a shared medical record with national 
databases, electronic CRC screening reminders, and a robust national research 
infrastructure with experience in conducting large-scale clinical trials. When 
completed, CONFIRM will be the largest intervention trial conducted within the 
VA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01239082)."

"OBJECTIVES: Annual testing using either a high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult 
blood test (HS-gFOBT) or a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is recommended for 
screening average-risk people for colorectal cancer. We compared the performance 
characteristics of the HS-gFOBT Hemoccult II SENSA and two FITs (InSure FIT and 
OC FIT-CHEK) for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasia.
METHODS: The study included 1,006 asymptomatic patients, aged 50-75 years, who 
were scheduled to receive a screening colonoscopy at gastroenterology practices 
in the Minneapolis and Indianapolis metropolitan areas. Each participant was 
asked to complete all three stool tests before their colonoscopy. Each test's 
performance characteristics were evaluated using the screening colonoscopic 
results as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasia was highest for 
InSure FIT (26.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.9-40.7), followed by OC 
FIT-CHEK (15.1%, 95% CI 6.7-26.1) and Hemoccult II SENSA (7.4%, 95% CI 
1.9-17.0). InSure FIT was statistically significantly more sensitive than both 
OC FIT-CHEK (absolute difference in sensitivity=11.2%, 95% CI 0.4-24.2) and 
Hemoccult II SENSA (difference in sensitivity=18.9%, 95% CI 10.2-32.6). 
Specificities were relatively high for all tests (between 96.8% and 98.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some FITs are more sensitive than the 
HS-gFOBT Hemoccult II SENSA, but these results need to be confirmed in larger 
asymptomatic populations. Comparisons between the FITs examined in this study 
and other FITs are needed to determine the best tests for population screening."

"Advances in basic immunology in 2016 included studies that further characterized 
the role of different proteins in the differentiation of effector T and B cells, 
including cytokines and proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton. Regulation 
of granule formation and secretion in cytotoxic cells was also further described 
by examining patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The role 
of prenylation in patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency leading to 
inflammation has been established. We reviewed advances in clinical immunology, 
as well as new approaches of whole-genome sequencing and genes newly reported to 
be associated with immunodeficiency, such as linker of activation of T cells 
(LAT); B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B); RGD, leucine-rich repeat, tropomodulin 
domain, and proline-rich domain-containing protein (RLTPR); moesin; and Janus 
kinase 1 (JAK1). Trials of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene 
therapy for primary immunodeficiency have had relative success; the use of 
autologous virus-specific cytotoxic T cells has proved effective as well. New 
medications are being explored, such as pioglitazone, which is under study for 
its role in enhancing the oxidative burst in patients with chronic granulomatous 
disease. Development of vaccines for HIV infection continues to provide insight 
into the immune response against a virus with an extraordinary mutation rate."

"The field of immunology is principally focused on the molecular mechanisms by 
which hematopoietic cells initiate and maintain innate and adaptive immunity. 
That cornerstone of attention has been expanded by recent discoveries that 
neuronal signals occupy a critical regulatory niche in immunity. The discovery 
is that neuronal circuits operating reflexively regulate innate and adaptive 
immunity. One particularly well-characterized circuit regulating innate 
immunity, the inflammatory reflex, is dependent upon action potentials 
transmitted to the reticuloendothelial system via the vagus and splenic nerves. 
This field has grown significantly with the identification of several other 
reflexes regulating discrete immune functions. As outlined in this review, the 
delineation of these mechanisms revealed a new understanding of immunity, 
enabled a first-in-class clinical trial using bioelectronic devices to inhibit 
cytokines and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and provided a 
mosaic view of immunity as the integration of hematopoietic and neural responses 
to infection and injury."

"BACKGROUND: Second primary malignancies are a major cause of excess morbidity 
and mortality in cancer survivors. Hodgkin lymphoma survivors who were treated 
with infradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and/or high-dose procarbazine have an 
increased risk to develop colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy surveillance plays an 
important role in colorectal cancer prevention by removal of the precursor 
lesions (adenomas) and early detection of cancer, resulting in improved survival 
rates. Therefore, Hodgkin lymphoma survivors treated with infradiaphragmatic 
radiotherapy and/or high-dose procarbazine could benefit from colonoscopy, or 
other surveillance modalities, which are expected to reduce colorectal cancer 
incidence and mortality. Current knowledge on clinicopathological and molecular 
characteristics of therapy-related colorectal cancer is limited. The 
pathogenesis of such colorectal cancers might be different from the pathogenesis 
in the general population and therefore these patients might require a different 
clinical approach. We designed a study with the primary aim to assess the 
diagnostic yield of a first surveillance colonoscopy among Hodgkin lymphoma 
survivors at increased risk of colorectal cancer and to compare these results 
with different screening modalities in the general population. Secondary aims 
include assessment of the test characteristics of stool tests and evaluation of 
burden, acceptance and satisfaction of CRC surveillance through two 
questionnaires.
METHODS/DESIGN: This prospective multicenter cohort study will include Hodgkin 
lymphoma survivors who survived ≥8 years after treatment with infradiaphragmatic 
radiotherapy and/or procarbazine (planned inclusion of 259 participants). Study 
procedures will consist of a surveillance colonoscopy with removal of precursor 
lesions (adenomas) and 6-8 normal colonic tissue biopsies, a fecal 
immunochemical test and a stool DNA test. All neoplastic lesions encountered 
will be classified using relevant histomorphological, immunohistochemical and 
molecular analyses in order to obtain more insight into colorectal 
carcinogenesis in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors. The Miscan-model will be used for 
cost-effectiveness analyses.
DISCUSSION: Evaluation of the diagnostic performance, patient acceptance and 
burden of colorectal cancer surveillance is necessary for future implementation 
of an individualized colorectal cancer surveillance program for Hodgkin lymphoma 
survivors. In addition, more insight into treatment-induced colorectal 
carcinogenesis will provide the first step towards prevention and personalized 
treatment. This information may be extrapolated to other groups of cancer 
survivors.

"BACKGROUND: Food allergy is an important public health problem because it 
affects children and adults, can be severe and even life-threatening, and may be 
increasing in prevalence. Beginning in 2008, the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, working with other organizations and advocacy groups, 
led the development of the first clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and 
management of food allergy. A recent landmark clinical trial and other emerging 
data suggest that peanut allergy can be prevented through introduction of 
peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy.
OBJECTIVES: Prompted by these findings, along with 25 professional 
organizations, federal agencies, and patient advocacy groups, the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facilitated development of addendum 
guidelines to specifically address the prevention of peanut allergy.
RESULTS: The addendum provides 3 separate guidelines for infants at various risk 
levels for the development of peanut allergy and is intended for use by a wide 
variety of health care providers. Topics addressed include the definition of 
risk categories, appropriate use of testing (specific IgE measurement, skin 
prick tests, and oral food challenges), and the timing and approaches for 
introduction of peanut-containing foods in the health care provider's office or 
at home. The addendum guidelines provide the background, rationale, and strength 
of evidence for each recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines have been developed for early introduction of 
peanut-containing foods into the diets of infants at various risk levels for 
peanut allergy."

"OBJECTIVES: Offering financial incentives to promote or ""nudge"" participation in 
cancer screening programs, particularly among vulnerable populations who 
traditionally have lower rates of screening, has been suggested as a strategy to 
enhance screening uptake. However, effectiveness of such practices has not been 
established. Our aim was to determine whether offering small financial 
incentives would increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening completion in a 
low-income, uninsured population.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial among 
primary care patients, aged 50-64 years, not up-to-date with CRC screening 
served by a large, safety net health system in Fort Worth, Texas. Patients were 
randomly assigned to mailed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) outreach (n=6,565), 
outreach plus a $5 incentive (n=1,000), or outreach plus a $10 incentive 
(n=1,000). Outreach included reminder phone calls and navigation to promote 
diagnostic colonoscopy completion for patients with abnormal FIT. Primary 
outcome was FIT completion within 1 year, assessed using an intent-to-screen 
analysis.
RESULTS: FIT completion was 36.9% with vs. 36.2% without any financial incentive 
(P=0.60) and was also not statistically different for the $10 incentive (34.6%, 
P=0.32 vs. no incentive) or $5 incentive (39.2%, P=0.07 vs. no incentive) 
groups. Results did not differ substantially when stratified by age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, or neighborhood poverty rate. Median time to FIT return also did 
not differ across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives, in the amount of $5 or $10 offered in 
exchange for responding to mailed invitation to complete FIT, do not impact CRC 
screening completion."

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We are in the process of conducting a randomized trial to 
determine whether compliance with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for 
colorectal cancer screening differs according to the stool-collection method. 
This study was an interim analysis of the performance of two stool-collection 
devices (sampling bottle vs conventional container).
METHODS: In total, 1,701 individuals (age range, 50 to 74 years) were randomized 
into the sampling bottle group (intervention arm) or the conventional container 
group (control arm). In both groups, we evaluated the FIT positivity rate, the 
positive predictive value for advanced neoplasia, and the detection rate for 
advanced neoplasia.
RESULTS: The FIT positivity rates were 4.1% for the sampling bottles and 2.0% 
for the conventional containers; these values were significantly different. The 
positive predictive values for advanced neoplasia in the sampling bottles and 
conventional containers were 11.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.4 to 25.6) 
and 12.0% (95% CI, -0.7 to 24.7), respectively. The detection rates for advanced 
neoplasia in the sampling bottles and conventional containers were 4.5 per 1,000 
persons (95% CI, 2.0 to 11.0) and 2.4 per 1,000 persons (95% CI, 0.0 to 5.0), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of these findings on FIT screening performance was 
unclear in this interim analysis. This impact should therefore be evaluated in 
the final analysis following the final enrollment period."

"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess prospectively the 
diagnostic accuracy of computer-assisted computed tomographic colonography (CTC) 
in the detection of polypoid (pedunculated or sessile) and nonpolypoid neoplasms 
and compare the accuracy between gastroenterologists and radiologists.
METHODS: This nationwide multicenter prospective controlled trial recruited 
1,257 participants with average or high risk of colorectal cancer at 14 Japanese 
institutions. Participants had CTC and colonoscopy on the same day. CTC images 
were interpreted independently by trained gastroenterologists and radiologists. 
The main outcome was the accuracy of CTC in the detection of neoplasms ≥6 mm in 
diameter, with colonoscopy results as the reference standard. Detection 
sensitivities of polypoid vs. nonpolypoid lesions were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 1,257 participants, 1,177 were included in the final analysis: 
42 (3.6%) were at average risk of colorectal cancer, 456 (38.7%) were at 
elevated risk, and 679 (57.7%) had recent positive immunochemical fecal occult 
blood tests. The overall per-participant sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
and negative predictive values for neoplasms ≥6 mm in diameter were 0.90, 0.93, 
0.83, and 0.96, respectively, among gastroenterologists and 0.86, 0.90, 0.76, 
and 0.95 among radiologists (P<0.05 for gastroenterologists vs. radiologists). 
The sensitivity and specificity for neoplasms ≥10 mm in diameter were 0.93 and 
0.99 among gastroenterologists and 0.91 and 0.98 among radiologists (not 
significant for gastroenterologists vs. radiologists). The CTC interpretation 
time by radiologists was shorter than that by gastroenterologists (9.97 vs. 
15.8 min, P<0.05). Sensitivities for pedunculated and sessile lesions exceeded 
those for flat elevated lesions ≥10 mm in diameter in both groups 
(gastroenterologists 0.95, 0.92, and 0.68; radiologists: 0.94, 0.87, and 0.61; 
P<0.05 for polypoid vs. nonpolypoid), although not significant (P>0.05) for 
gastroenterologists vs. radiologists.
CONCLUSIONS: CTC interpretation by gastroenterologists and radiologists was 
accurate for detection of polypoid neoplasms, but less so for nonpolypoid 
neoplasms. Gastroenterologists had a higher accuracy in the detection of 
neoplasms ≥6 mm than did radiologists, although their interpretation time was 
longer than that of radiologists."

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the participation and yield of the faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) in nonattendees for computed tomography colonography 
(CTC) or optical colonoscopy (OC) screening, in the setting of a randomized 
trial. In the SAVE trial, 16087 individuals were randomly assigned and invited 
to one of four interventions for colorectal cancer screening: (i) biennial FIT 
for three rounds; (ii) reduced-preparation CTC; (iii) full-preparation CTC; and 
(iv) OC. Nonattendees of reduced-preparation CTC, full-preparation CTC and OC 
groups were invited to FIT. Here, we analysed the participation rate and the 
detection rate for cancer or advanced adenoma (advanced neoplasia) of FIT among 
nonattendees for reduced-preparation CTC, full-preparation CTC and OC. 
Nonattendees were 1721 of 2395 (71.9%) eligible invitees in the 
reduced-preparation CTC group, 1818 of 2430 (74.8%) in the full-preparation CTC 
group and 883 of 1036 (85.2%) in the OC group. Participation rates for FIT were 
20.2% (347/1721) in nonattendees for reduced-preparation CTC, 21.4% (389/1818) 
in nonattendees for full-preparation CTC and 25.8% (228/883) in nonattendees for 
OC. Differences between both CTC groups and the OC group were statistically 
significant (P≤0.01), whereas the difference between reduced-preparation and 
full-preparation CTC groups was not statistically significant (P=0.38). The 
detection rate of FIT was not statistically significantly different among 
nonattendees for reduced-preparation CTC (0.9%; 3/347), nonattendees for 
full-preparation CTC (1.8%; 7/389) and nonattendees for OC (1.3%; 3/228) 
(P>0.05). Offering FIT to nonattendees for CTC or OC increases the overall 
participation in colorectal cancer screening and enables the detection of 
additional advanced neoplasia."

"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is a common malignancy and a leading cause of 
cancer-related death. Half of patients with colorectal cancer initially present 
with non-specific or vague symptoms. In the need for a safe low-cost test, the 
immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) may be part of the evaluation of 
such patients in primary care. Currently, Danish general practitioners have 
limited access to this test. The aim of this article is to describe a study that 
will assess the uptake and clinical use of iFOBT in general practice. 
Furthermore, it will investigate the diagnostic value and the clinical 
implications of using iFOBT in general practice on patients presenting with 
non-alarm symptoms of colorectal cancer.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a cluster-randomised stepped-wedge design and is 
conducted in the Central Denmark Region among 836 GPs in 381 general practices. 
The municipalities of the Region and their appertaining general practitioners 
will be included sequentially in the study during the first 7 months of the 
1-year study period. The following intervention has been developed for the 
study: a mandatory intervention providing all general practitioners with a 
starting package of 10 iFOBTs, a clinical instruction on iFOBT use in general 
practice and online information material from the date of inclusion, and an 
optional intervention consisting of a continuous medical education on colorectal 
cancer diagnostics and use of iFOBT.
DISCUSSION: This study is among the first and largest trials to investigate the 
diagnostic use and the clinical value of iFOBT on patients presenting with 
non-alarm symptoms of colorectal cancer. The findings will be of national and 
international importance for the future planning of colorectal cancer 
diagnostics, particularly for 'low-risk-but-not-no-risk' patients with non-alarm 
symptoms of colorectal cancer.

"BACKGROUND: If some adenomas do not bleed over several years, they will cause 
systematic false-negative fecal immunochemical test (FIT) results. The long-term 
effectiveness of FIT screening has been estimated without accounting for such 
systematic false-negativity. There are now data with which to evaluate this 
issue.
METHODS: The authors developed one microsimulation model (MISCAN 
[MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis]-Colon) without systematic false-negative 
FIT results and one model that allowed a percentage of adenomas to be 
systematically missed in successive FIT screening rounds. Both variants were 
adjusted to reproduce the first-round findings of the Dutch CORERO FIT screening 
trial. The authors then compared simulated detection rates in the second 
screening round with those observed, and adjusted the simulated percentage of 
systematically missed adenomas to those data. Finally, the authors calculated 
the impact of systematic false-negative FIT results on the effectiveness of 
repeated FIT screening.
RESULTS: The model without systematic false-negativity simulated higher 
detection rates in the second screening round than observed. These observed 
rates could be reproduced when assuming that FIT systematically missed 26% of 
advanced and 73% of nonadvanced adenomas. To reduce the false-positive rate in 
the second round to the observed level, the authors also had to assume that 30% 
of false-positive findings were systematically false-positive. Systematic 
false-negative FIT testing limits the long-term reduction of biennial FIT 
screening in the incidence of colorectal cancer (35.6% vs 40.9%) and its 
mortality (55.2% vs 59.0%) in participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study provide convincing evidence based 
on the combination of real-life and modeling data that a percentage of adenomas 
are systematically missed by repeat FIT screening. This impairs the efficacy of 
FIT screening. Cancer 2016;122:1680-8. © 2016 American Cancer Society."

"BACKGROUND: There is no information on the impact of age and gender on the 
diagnostic yield of different positivity thresholds for the fecal immunochemical 
test for hemoglobin (FIT).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of this test at distinct positivity 
cut-offs in a population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program.
METHODS: CRC detection rate (DR), and analysis of resources were evaluated 
retrospectively, at different cut-offs of FIT (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40μg Hb/g) 
respect to a reference value (15μg Hb/g), according to age and gender, in a 
screening population of 10,611 participants of the ColonPrev study (Quintero. 
NEJM 2013).
RESULTS: At the reference cut-off value, 36 CRC and 252 advanced adenomas (AA) 
were diagnosed. Increasing the cut-off in women ≤60 years decreases 
colonoscopies performed by 44.5% without modifying the CRC (DR). Same CRC DR was 
observed in men ≤60 years and women >60 years increasing cut-off at 25-30μg 
Hb/g. In men >60 years, all increases in the cut-off affected the CRC DR, 
especially when the cut-off was increased from 35 to 40μg Hb/g (CRC miss rate 
25%).
CONCLUSIONS: To improve the performance of FIT in CRC screening programs, FIT 
cut-offs could be individualized by age and gender."

"BACKGROUND: Poor participation rates are often observed in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) screening programs utilising faecal occult blood tests. This may be from 
dislike of faecal sampling, or having benign bleeding conditions that can 
interfere with test results. These barriers may be circumvented by offering a 
blood-based DNA test for screening. The aim was to determine if program 
participation could be increased by offering a blood test following faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) non-participation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: People were invited into a CRC screening study through 
their General Practice and randomised into control or intervention 
(n=600/group). Both groups were mailed a FIT (matching conventional screening 
programs). Participation was defined as FIT completion within 12wk. Intervention 
group non-participants were offered a screening blood test (methylated 
BCAT1/IKZF1). Overall participation was compared between the groups.
RESULTS: After 12wk, FIT participation was 82% and 81% in the control and 
intervention groups. In the intervention 96 FIT non- participants were offered 
the blood test - 22 completed this test and 19 completed the FIT instead. Total 
screening in the intervention group was greater than the control (88% vs 82%, 
p<0.01). Of 12 invitees who indicated that FIT was inappropriate for them 
(mainly due to bleeding conditions), 10 completed the blood test (83%).
CONCLUSIONS: Offering a blood test to FIT non-participants increased overall 
screening participation compared to a conventional FIT program. Blood test 
participation was particularly high in invitees who considered FIT to be 
inappropriate for them. A blood test may be a useful adjunct test within a FIT 
program."

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colonoscopy is the current reference standard for the 
detection of colorectal neoplasia, but nevertheless adenomas remain undetected. 
The Endocuff, an endoscopic cap with plastic projections, may improve colonic 
visualisation and adenoma detection. The aim of this study was to compare the 
mean number of adenomas per patient (MAP) and the adenoma detection rate (ADR) 
between Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy (EAC) and conventional colonoscopy (CC).
METHODS: We performed a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in five 
hospitals and included fecal immonochemical test (FIT)-positive screening 
participants as well as symptomatic patients (>45 years). Consenting patients 
were randomised 1:1 to EAC or CC. All colonoscopies were performed by 
experienced colonoscopists (≥500 colonoscopies) who were trained in EAC. All 
colonoscopy quality indicators were prospectively recorded.
FINDINGS: Of the 1063 included patients (52% male, median age 65 years), 530 
were allocated to EAC and 533 to CC. More adenomas were detected with EAC, 722 
vs 621, but the gain in MAP was not significant: on average 1.36 per patient in 
the EAC group versus 1.17 in the CC group (p=0.08). In a per-protocol analysis, 
the gain was 1.44 vs 1.19 (p=0.02), respectively. In the EAC group, 275 patients 
(52%) had one or more adenomas detected versus 278 in the CC group (52%; 
p=0.92). For advanced adenomas these numbers were 109 (21%) vs 117 (22%). The 
adjusted caecal intubation rate was lower with EAC (94% vs 99%; p<0.001), 
however when allowing crossover from EAC to CC, they were similar in both groups 
(98% vs 99%; p value=0.25).
INTERPRETATION: Though more adenomas are detected with EAC, the routine use of 
Endocuff does not translate in a higher number of patients with one or more 
adenomas detected. Whether increased detection ultimately results in a lower 
rate of interval carcinomas is not yet known.

"Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) was introduced in clinical practice more than 
100 years ago. The clinical effectiveness in allergic rhinitis (and asthma) and 
in hymenoptera allergy was apparent early on but it was not until the mid-1900s 
that randomized placebo-controlled trials proved its efficacy. In the 1980s, 
sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) was accepted in official guidelines. The 
availability of safer routes, such as SLIT, prompted increasing investigation of 
AIT for food allergy. The introduction of molecular-based diagnosis introduced 
the possibility of better targeted prescription of AIT. Other approaches are 
being explored, such as immunogenic peptides, recombinant allergens, and 
adjuvants."

"During the past decade, the development of humanized mouse models and their 
general applications in biomedical research greatly accelerated the translation 
of outcomes obtained from basic research into potential diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies in clinic. In this chapter, we firstly present an 
overview on the history and current progress of diverse humanized mouse models 
and then focus on those equipped with reconstituted human immune system. The 
update advancement in the establishment of humanized immune system mice and 
their applications in the studies of the development of human immune system and 
the pathogenesis of multiple human immune-related diseases are intensively 
reviewed here, while the shortcoming and perspective of these potent tools are 
discussed as well. As a valuable bridge across the gap between bench work and 
clinical trial, progressive humanized mouse models will undoubtedly continue to 
play an indispensable role in the wide area of biomedical research."

"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth commonest malignancy worldwide and 
still one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. The aim of this study 
was to identify a novel prognostic marker or therapeutic target for GC.
METHODS: We analyzed candidate genes from our previous Escherichia coli 
ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries in detail, and focused on the FKTN 
gene because it was overexpressed in both GC cell line CAST libraries, MKN-1 and 
MKN-45.
RESULTS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of FKTN revealed that 
FKTN messenger RNA was overexpressed in nine of 28 (32.1 %) GC tissue samples 
compared with nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. Immunostaining of fukutin showed 
that 297 of 695 cases (42.7 %) were positive for fukutin. Fukutin-positive GC 
cases were significantly associated with differentiated histological features, 
and advanced T grade and N grade. In addition, fukutin expression was observed 
more frequently in the intestinal phenotype (51 %) of GC than in other 
phenotypes (37 %) when defined by the expression patterns of mucin 5AC, mucin 6, 
mucin 2, and CD10. FKTN small interfering RNA treatment decreased GC cell 
proliferation.

"Food allergen oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an experimental, immune-modifying 
therapy that may induce clinical desensitization in some patients. OIT is still 
in early phase clinical research, but some providers may offer OIT as a clinical 
service. To understand the current practices of allergists who perform OIT, an 
online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the American Academy of Allergy 
Asthma & Immunology. Among 442 respondents, 61 reported participating in using 
OIT (13.8%), including 28 in nonacademic settings. Informed consent for OIT was 
obtained by 91.3%, institutional review board approval by 47.7% and 
Investigational New Drug approval by 38.1%. Compared with nonacademic 
participants, more academic participants used peanut OIT, obtained institutional 
review board and Investigational New Drug (P < .0001 respectively), and 
challenged patients before entry (P = .008). More nonacademic providers billed 
the patient or insurance for reimbursement (P < .0001). Low reported regard for 
the importance for US Food and Drug Administration approval or a standardized 
product (increased odds), and a high regard for better safety data (decreased 
odds) were associated with considering offering OIT as a service. Significant 
differences exist with OITs that occur in academic versus nonacademic settings. 
Further assessment is needed regarding the different motivations and practice 
styles among providers who offer OIT and those who are considering doing so."

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colonoscopy is the recommended screening procedure for 
first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), but few studies 
have compared its efficacy for CRC detection with that of other screening 
strategies. We conducted a controlled randomized trial to compare the efficacy 
of repeated fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) and colonoscopy in detecting 
advanced neoplasia (advanced adenoma or CRC) in family members of patients with 
CRC.
METHODS: In a prospective study, 1918 first-degree relatives of patients with 
CRC were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive a single colonoscopy 
examination or 3 FITs (1/year for 3 years; OC-Sensor; cutoff ≥10 μg hemoglobin/g 
feces, corresponding to 50 ng hemoglobin/mL buffer). The strategies were 
considered to be equivalent if the 95% confidence interval of the difference for 
the detection of advanced neoplasia was ±3%. Follow-up analyses were performed 
to identify false-negative FIT results and interval CRCs.
RESULTS: Of all eligible asymptomatic first-degree relatives, 782 were included 
in the colonoscopy group and 784 in the FIT group. In the intention-to-screen 
analysis, advanced neoplasia was detected in 33 (4.2%) and 44 (5.6%) 
first-degree relatives in the FIT and colonoscopy groups, respectively (odds 
ratio = 1.41; 95% confidence interval: 0.88-2.26; P = .14). In the per-protocol 
analysis, 28 first-degree relatives (3.9%) in the FIT group and 43 (5.8%) in the 
colonoscopy group had advanced neoplasia (odds ratio = 1.56; 95% confidence 
interval: 0.95-2.56; P = .08). FIT missed 16 of 41 advanced adenomas but no 
CRCs. The FIT strategy required endoscopic evaluation of 4-fold fewer 
individuals to detect 1 advanced neoplasia than the colonoscopy strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated FIT screening (1/year for 3 years) detected all CRCs and 
proved equivalent to colonoscopy in detecting advanced neoplasia in first-degree 
relatives of patients with CRC. This strategy should be considered for 
populations where compliance with FITs is higher than with colonoscopy.

"Allergic rhinitis and asthma represent global problems of public health 
affecting all age groups; asthma and allergic rhinitis frequently coexist in the 
same patients. In Latin American prevalence of allergic rhinitis, although 
variable, is very high. Allergic rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 
started during a workshop of the World Health Organization performed in 1999 and 
was published in 2001. ARIA proposed a new classification of allergic rhinitis 
in intermittent or persistent and mild or moderate-severe. This approach of 
classification reflects more nearly the impact of allergic rhinitis in patients. 
In its review of 2010 ARIA developed guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of 
allergic rhinitis and of clinical practices for management of comorbidities of 
allergic rhinitis and asthma based on GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, 
Development and Evaluation). ARIA has been spread and implemented in more than 
50 countries. In Latin American an intense activity has been developed to spread 
these recommendations in almost all the countries of the region and it is 
important to record the obtained goals in the diffusion and implementation of 
ARIA, as well as to identify the unsatisfied needs from the clinical, research 
and implementation points of view. Final objective is to reinforce the priority 
that allergy and asthma should have, especially in children, in the programs of 
public health, as they have been prioritized in European Union in 2011."
"Publisher: La rinitis alérgica y el asma representan problemas globales de salud 
pública que afectan a todos los grupos etarios; el asma y la rinitis alérgica 
frecuentemente coexisten en los mismos pacientes. En América Latina la 
prevalencia de rinitis alérgica, aunque variable, es muy elevada. La iniciativa 
Rinitis Alérgica y su Impacto en Asma (globalmente conocida como ARIA, de su 
nombre en inglés Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) comenzó durante un 
taller de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) realizado en 1999 que se 
publicó en el año 2001. ARIA propuso una nueva clasificación de rinitis alérgica 
en intermitente o persistente y leve o moderada-severa. Este esquema de 
clasificación refleja más estrechamente el impacto de la rinitis alérgica en los 
pacientes. En su revisión de 2010, la guía ARIA desarrolló pautas para el 
diagnóstico y tratamiento de la rinitis alérgica y de prácticas clínicas para el 
manejo de las comorbilidades de la rinitis alérgica y el asma basadas en GRADE 
(Gradación de Recomendaciones, Desarrollo y Evaluación). ARIA se ha diseminado e 
implantado en más de 50 países. En América Latina se ha desarrollado una intensa 
actividad para diseminar estas recomendaciones en casi todos los países de la 
región y es importante llevar un registro de los logros obtenidos en la difusión 
e implantación de ARIA, además de identificar las necesidades insatisfechas 
desde el punto de vista clínico, de la investigación y de la implantación. El 
objetivo final es reforzar la prioridad que deben tener la alergia y el asma 
–especialmente en niños– en los programas de Salud Pública, tal como los 
priorizó la Unión Europea en 2011."

"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate whether oral anticoagulants (OACs) alter faecal 
immunochemical test (FIT) performance in average-risk colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening.
METHODS: Individuals aged 50-69 years were invited to receive one FIT sample 
(cutoff 75 ng ml(-1)) between November 2008 and June 2011.
RESULTS: Faecal immunochemical test was positive in 9.3% (21 out of 224) of 
users of OAC and 6.2% (365 out of 5821) of non-users (P-trend=0.07). The 
positive predictive value (PPV) for advanced neoplasia (AN) in non-users was 
50.4% vs 47.6% in users (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.3-1.8; P=0.5). The PPV for 
AN in OAC more antiplatelets (aspirin or clopidogrel) was 75% (odds ratio, 2; 
95% CI, 0.4-10.8; P=0.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Oral anticoagulant did not significantly modify the PPV for AN in 
this population-based colorectal screening program. The detection rate of 
advanced adenoma was higher in the combination OAC more antiplatelets."

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of aspirin and nonaspirin antiplatelet agents 
(NAAAs) on the performance of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of results from a 
clinical trial that involved 28,696 asymptomatic average-risk men and women aged 
50 to 69 years invited to participate in a colorectal cancer screening program 
with FIT between November 1, 2008, and June 31, 2011.
RESULTS: The test was returned by 6390 individuals (22.3%), of whom 5821 (91.1%) 
reported not using antiplatelet drugs (nonusers group) and 569 (8.9%) reported 
using these drugs at the time of testing (users group). The FIT result was 
positive in 48 of 569 users (8.4%) and 365 of 5821 nonusers (6.3%) (P=.05). A 
positive FIT result was found in 7.3% (28/384) of aspirin users, 7.1% (10/140) 
of NAAA users, and 22.2% (10/45) of those undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy 
(DAPT) (aspirin plus an NAAA). The DAPT subgroup had a significantly higher 
positive FIT rate than the nonuser group (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.3; 
P<.05). The positive predictive value (PPV) for advanced neoplasia (AN) in 
nonusers was 50.4% vs 50.0% in users (P = .40). The PPV for AN was 57.0% in 
aspirin users, 30.0% in NAAA users, and 50.0% in DAPT users, without 
statistically significant differences between the user and nonuser groups.
CONCLUSION: The use of DAPT increased the rate of positive FIT results. Use of 
aspirin, NAAAs, or both did not modify the PPV for AN in this population-based 
colorectal screening program."

"Discomfort with the collection of a stool sample is a frequently cited barrier 
for participation in fecal test-based colorectal cancer screening. The objective 
was to evaluate whether a feces collection paper enhances participation in a 
fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-based colorectal cancer screening program. 
Randomized clinical trial. Second round of a biannual Dutch FIT-based colorectal 
cancer screening program pilot. A random sample of 10 265 individuals from the 
general population, men and women aged 50-75 years at an average risk for 
colorectal cancer, was eligible for participation. Invitees were randomized to 
an FIT-only group (n=5136) or an FIT in combination with a feces collection 
paper group (n=5129). The main outcome measure was participation in screening. 
Overall, 5367 tests of 10 265 were returned (52%). In the FIT-only group, 2694 
tests were returned [52%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 51-54%] versus 2673 
tests in the collection paper group (52%; 95% CI: 51-54%). This difference in 
the participation rate was not significant (relative risk: 0.99; 95% CI: 
0.97-1.04). A feces collection paper does not increase participation rates in 
FIT-based colorectal cancer screening. Future studies should explore other ways 
of facilitating participation in colorectal cancer screening programs."

"Despite numerous attempts over many years to develop an HIV vaccine based on 
classical strategies, none has convincingly succeeded to date. A number of 
approaches are being pursued in the field, including building upon possible 
efficacy indicated by the recent RV144 clinical trial, which combined two HIV 
vaccines. Here, we argue for an approach based, in part, on understanding the 
HIV envelope spike and its interaction with broadly neutralizing antibodies 
(bnAbs) at the molecular level and using this understanding to design immunogens 
as possible vaccines. BnAbs can protect against virus challenge in animal 
models, and many such antibodies have been isolated recently. We further propose 
that studies focused on how best to provide T cell help to B cells that produce 
bnAbs are crucial for optimal immunization strategies. The synthesis of rational 
immunogen design and immunization strategies, together with iterative 
improvements, offers great promise for advancing toward an HIV vaccine."

"Web-based modules may facilitate instruction on core topics in allergy and 
immunology (AI). Pretests (PTs) have been shown to improve learning in Web-based 
courses, but their effectiveness in comparison with advance organizers (AOs) is 
unknown. We performed a randomized controlled trial of a Web-based educational 
intervention for teaching the practical aspects of allergen immunotherapy (AIT). 
AI Fellows-in-Training were randomly assigned to receive the introduction to the 
modules in an AO outline (AO group) or as PT questions (PT group). The primary 
outcome was the difference in posttest scores between groups. The secondary 
outcome was the difference in PT and posttest scores in the PT group. Thirty 
participants in the AO group and 35 in the PT group completed the modules and 
the posttest. The mean (SD) posttest score for the AO group was 74% (14%) 
compared with 73% (9%) for the PT group, a mean difference of -1% (95% CI, -7%, 
5%; p = 0.67). A multivariate analysis controlling for year-in-training and 
total time spent on the modules revealed virtually identical results. The mean 
(SD) PT score for the PT group increased from 49 (10%) to 73% (9%), a mean 
difference of 24% (95% CI, 19%, 28%; p < 0.0001). Introducing Web-based allergy 
education with PT questions or an AO resulted in similar posttest scores. 
Posttest scores in the PT group improved significantly compared with PT scores."

"INTRODUCTION: Only about half of all eligible Americans have been screened for 
colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective of this study was to test whether mailed 
educational materials and a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), with or without a 
scripted telephone reminder, led to FIT testing. In addition, we compared 
changes in attitudes toward, readiness for, and barriers to screening from 
baseline to follow-up after education about screening.
METHODS: Subjects due for CRC screening were recruited from 16 Iowa Research 
Network family physician offices. Half of the subjects were randomized to 
receive mailed written and DVD educational materials, along with a FIT, either 
with or without a telephone call designed to encourage screening and address 
barriers. Subjects completed surveys regarding their attitudes and readiness for 
CRC screening at baseline and after education about screening. The main outcome 
was whether the subject completed FIT testing.
RESULTS: A total of 373 individuals received educational materials (including a 
FIT) and 231 (62%) returned a posteducation survey. The mean age was 61.2 years; 
52% were women, 99% were white, 39% had a high school education or less, 39% had 
a total family income of less than $40,000, and 7% had no insurance. The written 
materials were read by 82%, understood by 91% (of those who read them), and 82% 
felt their knowledge was increased. The DVD was viewed by 67%, understood by 94% 
of those who viewed it, and 86% felt the DVD increased their knowledge. Compared 
with baseline, individuals reported being significantly more likely to bring up 
CRC screening at their next doctor's visit (P < .0001) and being more likely to 
be tested for CRC in the next 6 months (P < .0001). Comparing baseline with 
follow-up, summary attitude scores improved (P < .0001), readiness scores 
improved (P < .0001), and there were fewer barriers (P = .034, Wilcoxon signed 
rank). The FIT return rate increased from 0% to 45.2% in the education alone 
group and from 0% to 48.7% for the group receiving education plus the telephone 
call (P < .0001 for each group individually and overall when compared with 
Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa).
CONCLUSIONS: Mailing FIT kits with easy-to-understand educational materials 
improved attitudes toward screening and dramatically increased CRC screening 
rates among patients who were due for screening in a practice-based research 
network. A telephone call addressing barriers to screening did not result in 
increased FIT testing compared with mailed education alone."

"OBJECTIVE: To compare the uptake of faecal immunochemical occult blood test 
(FIT) with guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) in a screening programme, 
with specific attention to the demographic and socioeconomic factors that might 
affect test uptake.
SETTING: The Clalit Health Service screening programme, Israel.
METHODS: Average-risk individuals aged 50-75 years were randomized into a FIT 
arm or gFOBT arm using a programme based on the socioeconomic status (SES) of 
their primary care clinics. G-FOBT was performed with Hemoccult SENSA™ (3 
evacuations) and FIT with the OC- MICRO(TM) (3 evacuations, refrigerating 
mandated). The GLIMMIX model was used.
RESULTS: There were 5,464 and 10,668 eligible participants in the FIT and gFOBT 
arms respectively. Compliance in taking the kits was better (but not 
statistically significantly better) with gFOBT (37.8% vs. 29.3%; odds ratio [OR] 
1.43 [95% CI 0.73-2.80]; P = 0.227). Kit return was higher in the FIT arm (65.0% 
vs. 78.9%; OR 0.45 [95% CI 0.24-0.83], P = 0.021). Overall test uptake was 
affected by age, gender, being immigrant and SES (determined by whether or not 
the participant paid national insurance tax, and the SES of the primary care 
clinic). The overall uptake of gFOBT and FIT was comparable (OR 0.996 [95% CI 
0.46-2.17], P = 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall compliance for test uptake was comparable between the two 
methods despite the more demanding procedure in the FIT arm. Sociodemographic 
parameters were the major determinants of compliance. An educational programme, 
with emphasis on the sociodemographic characteristics of the target population, 
should be instigated."

"Screening programmes based on single modality testing may prevent individuals 
with a preference for a different test from participating. We conducted a 
population-based trial to determine whether nonparticipants in flexible 
sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening were willing to attend faecal immunochemical test 
(FIT) screening. In total, 8,407 subjects were invited in a primary FS screening 
programme. Invitees did not know at the time of FS invitation that 
nonparticipants would be offered FIT screening. A total of 4,407 nonparticipants 
of FS screening were invited for FIT screening (cut-off 50 ng haemoglobin/ml). 
The participation rate to FS screening was 31% [95% confidence interval (CI): 
30-32%]. Among the FS nonparticipants 25% (CI: 24-26%) did attended FIT 
screening. The participation rate of the two-stage recruitment for FS and FIT 
screening was 45% (CI: 44-46%). FIT screenees were older (p = 0.02), more often 
women (p < 0.001) and had a lower social economic status (p = 0.01) than FS 
screenees. The detection rate (DR) for advanced adenoma was 3.5% (CI: 2.5-4.8%), 
and for colorectal cancer (CRC) it was 0.3% (CI: 0.1-0.8%) among participants to 
FIT screening. The DR of the two-stage recruitment was 6.1% (n = 202) for an 
advanced adenoma and 0.5% (n = 16) for a CRC. In conclusion, offering FIT 
screening to nonparticipants in a FS screening programme increases the overall 
participation rate considerably, as a quarter of nonparticipants of FS screening 
was willing to attend FIT screening. The participation rate remains lower for 
primary FIT screening in the same population (62%). Women in the target 
population were more likely to refuse FS than FIT screening. Countries 
introducing FS screening should be aware of these preferences."

"Olopatadine is a tricyclic compound with antihistaminic, mast cell-stabilizing, 
and anti-inflammatory properties. In the United States olopatadine is approved 
as a b.i.d. ophthalmic solution, Patanol (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, 
TX) to treat all signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and as a q.d. 
formulation, Pataday (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.), to treat itching associated 
with allergic conjunctivitis. A nasal spray, Patanase (Alcon Laboratories, 
Inc.), was approved in 2008 for treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic 
rhinitis. The available data on olopatadine was assessed with regard to future 
uses through a comprehensive literature review and a Roundtable Discussion held 
at the 2009 meeting of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. 
The unique mechanisms of action of olopatadine still under study include mast 
cell stabilization, potent H(1)-anthistaminic activity, and anti-inflammatory 
effects. Data support consideration of nasal olopatadine for as-needed use for 
episodic symptoms of allergic rhinitis, for treatment of nonallergic rhinitis, 
and for use in combination with topical steroids for patients with 
moderate-to-severe allergy symptoms."

whom fecal blood testing was appropriate. We invited randomly selected patients 
by mail to participate in a study comparing FIT and gFOBT. We randomly allocated 
404 subjects to receive FIT (n=202) or gFOBT (n=202) by mail. We determined the 
proportion of subjects completing testing within 90days of agreeing to 
participate in the study. We also used multivariate logistic regression to 
evaluate screening completion, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinic 
site, previous gFOBT testing, and co-morbidity.
RESULTS: Screening adherence was higher with FIT than gFOBT (61.4% vs. 50.5%, 
P=0.03). The adjusted odds ratio for completing FIT vs. gFOBT was 1.56, 95% CI

"In 2009, reports on basic and clinical immunology had an increased focus on 
human disease mechanisms and management. The molecular pathogenesis of familial 
angioedema associated with estrogen was further explored to find possible 
factors affecting severity, including polymorphisms in enzymes and receptors 
related to bradykinin pathways. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of C1 
esterase inhibitor concentrate in patients with hereditary angioedema 
demonstrated the safety of its use and its efficacy to reduce the duration of 
angioedema attacks. The interaction of innate immunity and adaptive responses 
was further examined in several reports, establishing the significant role of 
Toll-like receptor stimulation for the development of optimal specific antibody 
responses. The 2009 update of the classification of primary immunodeficiencies 
introduced more than 15 new genetic defects related to the immune response, 
including of dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) mutations, which are responsible 
for the autosomal recessive form of the hyper-IgE syndrome. Other reports 
expanded the clinical spectrum of disease and improved the characterization of 
conditions such as warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, and myelokathexis syndrome or 
the occurrence of mucormycosis and Serratia species infections in patients with 
chronic granulomatous disease. The frequent presentation of gastrointestinal 
disorders in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies was recognized, and 
recommendations for management were reviewed. Clinical research focused on 
severe combined immunodeficiency included the development and implementation of 
a state-wide newborn screening program for this condition, a desired goal 
considering the significant reduction of mortality rate when the diagnosis is 
made early before opportunistic infections occur."

"PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between oxygen-sensitive Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) and oxygen measurements in prostate cancer.
METHODS: Nine men underwent MRI examinations followed by needle oxygen 
measurements of tumor bearing region within prostate gland and five men further 
consented to biopsy. Median pO2 and hypoxic fraction < 5 mm Hg (HP5) were 
derived. Biopsies were immunostained for Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CA IX), Hypoxia 
Inducible Factor-1 (HIF 1) and Glucose Transporter-1 (GLUT 1). Corresponding 
Regions-of-Interest (ROI) were delineated on T2-weighted (T2w) MRI by two 
observers. Median R2* was calculated for each ROI. Spearman correlation was 
calculated between R2* and HP5/pO2.
RESULTS: MRI quality evaluation resulted in exclusion of 4/18 ROI due to motion 
(n = 2) and rectal air susceptibility artifact (n = 2). Quality of remaining 
data was validated by concordance of R2* with T2w, indices and with secondary 
observer R2* (r = 0.94, p = 0.005). Correlation was observed between R2* and HP5 
(r = 0.76, p = 0.02) and a trend was noted between R2* and pO2 (r = -0.66, p = 
0.07). GLUT 1 and HIF 1 were expressed in all patients, and CA IX was expressed 
in one patient with high HP5 (77%) and low pO2 (1.4 mm Hg).
CONCLUSIONS: MRI using R2* quantification is a promising tool for non-invasive 
imaging of prostate cancer hypoxia."

"BACKGROUND: The mitogenic and growth-stimulatory effects of insulin-like growth 
factors appear to play a role in prostate carcinogenesis, yet any direct 
association of circulating insulin levels and risk of prostate cancer remains 
unclear.
METHODS: We investigated the relationship of the level of serum insulin, 
glucose, and surrogate indices of insulin resistance (ie, the molar ratio of 
insulin to glucose and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 
[HOMA-IR]) to the development of prostate cancer in a case-cohort study within 
the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort of Finnish 
men. We studied 100 case subjects with incident prostate cancer and 400 noncase 
subjects without prostate cancer from the larger cohort. Fasting serum was 
collected 5-12 years before diagnosis. We determined insulin concentrations with 
a double-antibody immunochemiluminometric assay and glucose concentrations with 
a hexokinase assay. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated relative 
risks as odds ratios (ORs), and all statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Insulin concentrations in fasting serum that was collected on average 
9.2 years before diagnosis among case subjects were 8% higher than among noncase 
subjects, and the molar ratio of insulin to glucose and HOMA-IR were 10% and 6% 
higher, respectively, but these differences were not statistically significant. 
Among subjects in the second through fourth insulin quartiles, compared with 
those in the first quartile, increased insulin levels were associated with 
statistically significantly increased risks of prostate cancer (OR = 1.50, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 3.03; OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 0.86 to 3.56; and 
OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.18 to 5.51; for the second through fourth insulin 
quartiles, respectively; P(trend) = .02). A similar pattern was observed with 
the HOMA-IR (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.26; P(trend) = .02) for the highest 
vs lowest quartiles. Risk varied inconsistently with glucose concentration 
(P(trend) = .38). A stronger association between insulin level and prostate 
cancer risk was observed among leaner men and among men who were less physically 
active at work. Crude prostate cancer incidence was 154 prostate cancers per 100 
000 person-years in the lowest quartile of fasting serum insulin vs 394 prostate 
cancers per 100 000 person-years in the highest quartile.
CONCLUSION: Elevated fasting levels of serum insulin (but not glucose) within 
the normal range appear to be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer."

"BACKGROUND: The aim of colorectal cancer screening is to improve prognosis by 
the detection of early cancer and precursor stages. We compared the stage 
distribution of asymptomatic colorectal cancer patients detected by a positive 
immunochemical or guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (FOBT) with symptomatic 
colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: In a longitudinal cohort study tumour stages were assessed in 144 
symptomatic (mean age 69.3 years, 56% male) and 41 asymptomatic colorectal 
cancer patients (mean age 64.9 years, 56% male) of which 11 were detected with 
guaiac FOBT s (G-FOBT, Hemoccult-II) and 30 with immunochemical FOBTs (I-FOBT, 
OCSensor). Stage distributions were used to calculate average stage specific 
predicted five-year survival rates and to analyse group differences with 
Wilcoxon log-rank test.
RESULTS: Colorectal cancer was detected in significantly earlier stages in 
symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients patients (p<0.0001). Average 
stage specific predicted five-year survival was 59.1% in symptomatic and 76.6% 
in asymptomatic patients. Compared with the symptomatic patients the stage 
distribution for colorectal cancer patients detected with Hemoccult-II was not 
significantly different(p=0.29), whereas colorectal cancer was detected at 
significantly earlier stages with the OCSensor (p<0.0001).Treatment could be 
confined to colonoscopy in 27% of the asymptomatic patients compared with 3% of 
the symptomatic patients (p<0.0001). Cancer distribution over the colon was 
comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p=0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with symptomatic patients,patients detected by FOBT and 
especially immunochemical FOBT , presented significantly more often at earlier 
stages suggesting increased survival. Additionally treatment could more often be 
confined to colonoscopy."

"Immunochemical faecal occult blood testing (FIT) provides quantitative test 
results, which allows optimisation of the cut-off value for follow-up 
colonoscopy. We conducted a randomised population-based trial to determine test 
characteristics of FIT (OC-Sensor micro, Eiken, Japan) screening at different 
cut-off levels and compare these with guaiac-based faecal occult blood test 
(gFOBT) screening in an average risk population. A representative sample of the 
Dutch population (n=10 011), aged 50-74 years, was 1 : 1 randomised before 
invitation to gFOBT and FIT screening. Colonoscopy was offered to screenees with 
a positive gFOBT or FIT (cut-off 50 ng haemoglobin/ml). When varying the cut-off 
level between 50 and 200 ng ml(-1), the positivity rate of FIT ranged between 
8.1% (95% CI: 7.2-9.1%) and 3.5% (95% CI: 2.9-4.2%), the detection rate of 
advanced neoplasia ranged between 3.2% (95% CI: 2.6-3.9%) and 2.1% (95% CI: 
1.6-2.6%), and the specificity ranged between 95.5% (95% CI: 94.5-96.3%) and 
98.8% (95% CI: 98.4-99.0%). At a cut-off value of 75 ng ml(-1), the detection 
rate was two times higher than with gFOBT screening (gFOBT: 1.2%; FIT: 2.5%; 
P<0.001), whereas the number needed to scope (NNscope) to find one screenee with 
advanced neoplasia was similar (2.2 vs 1.9; P=0.69). Immunochemical faecal 
occult blood testing is considerably more effective than gFOBT screening within 
the range of tested cut-off values. From our experience, a cut-off value of 75 
ng ml(-1) provided an adequate positivity rate and an acceptable trade-off 
between detection rate and NNscope."

"The field of treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has been in a continuous 
flux over the last 10-15 years owing to the introduction of new therapeutic 
approaches such as dose-dense chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies and high-dose 
chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The 
use of clinical prognostic factors has improved our ability to predict the 
outcome of these lymphomas; moreover, the gene and protein expression pattern 
has been shown, at least in the pre-rituximab era, to be an independent and 
powerful prognostic indicator. This review will focus on results obtained in the 
last decade by large clinical trials evaluating the first-line therapy in 
nonlocalized diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; special emphasis will be placed on 
more mature results that can be indicated as 'standard' therapy. Ongoing studies 
addressing as yet unanswered or controversial questions will be analyzed, and 
preliminary data will be critically reviewed."

"In this age of evidence-based medicine, clinical research is critical for 
developing new therapeutics and determining the best way to use these therapies. 
To perform appropriate clinical research, researchers must adhere to ethical 
standards. These standards have developed in large part as a response to 
egregious violations of ethically appropriate behavior. In this respect certain 
populations have been identified as at risk of being treated inappropriately in 
medical research. Current ethical guidelines prohibit or severely limit what 
types of research can be performed involving these ""vulnerable"" populations. 
Although this might protect these populations, the lack of research on them 
might actually do harm in limiting their access to life-saving therapies. We 
explore the historical underpinnings of protecting the vulnerable populations 
and whether a newer ethical paradigm that would allow for protected research on 
these populations should be adopted by society."

"Angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels form from existing 
vasculature, is critical for tumor growth and invasion. Growth factors, such as 
VEGF, initiate signaling cascades resulting in the proliferation of resting 
endothelial cells. Blockade of growth factor pathways has proven effective in 
inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Integrins, including the 
integrin alpha5beta1, are also important mediators of angiogenesis and these 
adhesion molecules also regulate cancer cell growth and migration in vitro. 
Volociximab is a high affinity, function-blocking antibody against integrin 
alpha5beta1 that is currently in multiple Phase II oncology clinical trials. 
Volociximab displays potent anti-angiogenic activity in a monkey model of 
choroidal neovascularization. In this study, we explored the consequences of 
integrin alpha5beta1 blockade on tumorigenesis. Because volociximab does not 
cross-react with rodent alpha5beta1, the syngeneic rabbit VX2 carcinoma model 
was utilized as an alternative to standard mouse xenograft models for the 
assessment of anti-tumor activity of volociximab. Volociximab administered 
intravenously to rabbits bearing VX2 tumors is detectable on tumor cells and 
vasculature 45 min post-administration. Volociximab was found to significantly 
inhibit the growth of tumors growing subcutaneously or intramuscularly, despite 
a 20-fold lower affinity for rabbit integrin, relative to human. This effect was 
found to correlate with decreased blood vessel density within these tumors. 
These results support the use of volociximab in the intervention of malignant 
disease."

"TAFI was measured as relative activity concentration (Pefakit) and antigen 
concentration (Haemochrom and Asserachrom) both acutely and during convalescence 
in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome, and in a group of healthy 
controls. There was a rather weak but significant correlation between the 
activity and antigen concentrations. The results obtained by the Haemochrom 
method, assumed to measure the concentrations of all forms of TAFI, were lower 
than those by the Asserachrom method although the latter is assumed to only 
measure the pro-TAFI concentration. Both immunoassays gave lower results than 
the functional method (Pefakit). The patients in the convalescence phase showed 
a higher activity concentration than the healthy controls. The Asserachrom 
showed a higher concentration in the acute and convalescence phases of the 
patients compared to the controls, whereas the Haemochrom did not show any such 
difference. This could be related to different species of the TAFI molecule and 
thus different reactivity to the antibodies. Therefore the optimal choice of 
assay for determination of TAFI in different clinical studies is of importance. 
The Pefakit and Asserachrom seem to be appropriate candidates."

"OBJECTIVE: To review the available evidence on treating chronic cough to relay a 
thoughtful, evidence-based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic 
cough.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using the 
following keywords: cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, rhinitis 
(allergic, seasonal), postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, lung disease 
(interstitial), bronchiectasis, and bronchoscopy.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis 
and treatment of chronic cough. Because of a lack of randomized prospective 
studies, nonrandomized and retrospective studies were considered, with their 
strengths and limitations noted.
RESULTS: Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and 
treatment of chronic cough. There are several prospective noncontrolled trials 
for adults with chronic cough that found a high percentage of cough resolution 
when using an approach that focused on the diagnosis and treatment of the most 
common causes: asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough 
syndrome. Preliminary studies in children support an approach that distinguishes 
between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigation of any 
specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness.
CONCLUSION: Allergists, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway 
disorders, are uniquely poised to diagnose and treat chronic cough."

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss advances in immunotherapy as pertaining to 
systemic therapy for sarcomas.
RECENT FINDINGS: Developments in immunology will have direct relevance to 
studies in sarcomas and other cancers in the near future. Vaccines employing 
peptides are the backbone of many studies today due to issues of cost and ease 
of production, but intact or transfected whole tumor cells or antigen-pulsed or 
transfected dendritic cells are now being investigated as the immunogenic 
principle in sarcomas and other cancers. The importance of dendritic cells in 
generating immune responses is better appreciated than ever, as is the role of 
CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells in mediating immune responses. Enhancing 
costimulatory signals to T cells using anti-CD152 (CTLA4) and other antibodies 
or expanding anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes ex vivo are other means to 
enhance immunity to sarcoma-specific antigens.
SUMMARY: As of 2006, few studies are examining the utility of immunotherapy in 
sarcomas. However, a detailed understanding of the remarkable mechanics of how 
an immune response is mounted and how T cell activation and/or proliferation can 
be halted by the tumor will be central to properly design new studies of 
immunological agents against sarcomas and other cancers."

"INTRODUCTION: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial aimed at assessing the 
effect of the type of faecal occult blood, guaiac or immunochemical test on 
screening compliance.
METHODS: We sampled 130 general practitioners (GPs) who consented to participate 
in the trial. We randomly allocated half of them to the guaiac (Hemo-Fec) and 
half to the immunochemical test (OC-Hemodia). We sampled 2/10 of the GPs' 
50-75-year-old patients (n=7332) and randomly divided this population into half. 
One half was invited to be screened at the GP's office and the other to the 
nearest gastroenterology ward. The principal outcome was the percentage of 
returned tests.
RESULTS: The immunochemical test had a compliance of 35.8% and the guaiac of 
30.4% (relative risk [RR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.44). The 
difference was mostly due to a higher probability of returning the sample: 93.8% 
and 88.6% for immunochemical and guaiac, respectively (RR 1.06; 95% CI 
1.02-1.10). The guaiac test had a higher prevalence of positives (10.3% versus 
6.3%, RR 0.603; 95% CI 0.433-0.837). There was a higher variability in the 
results obtained with the guaiac test compared with the immunochemical (F[1, 12] 
= 16.25; P=0.0017).
CONCLUSIONS: Compliance is more likely with the immunochemical than the guaiac 
test, independent of the provider. Guaiac tests show a higher variability of the 
results among centres. The successful implementation of a screening programme 
requires a period of standardization of the test reading in order to avoid 
unexpected work overload for colonoscopy services."

"BACKGROUND: The metastatic potential of tumors is dependent on the cell to cell 
adhesion by cell surface carbohydrate antigens. Thus, expression of sialyl 
Lewis(a), which is one of the important molecules of cell surface carbohydrates, 
may serve as a prognostic marker of aggressive and metastasizing tumor growth. 
However, the prognostic value of sialyl Lewis(a) expression in colon cancer is 
still controversial.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the expression of sialyl Lewis(a) 
antigen in 233 colon cancer specimens from patients who were registered in a 
prospective adjuvant immunochemotherapy clinical trial. The clinical course and 
the prognosis of the patients were evaluated after all the immunohistochemical 
analyses had been performed.
RESULTS: Sialyl Lewis(a) expression levels were correlated with both overall 
survival (P = 0.0006) and disease-free survival (P = 0.004) in all patients with 
the log-rank test. This result could be assumed to have been influenced by the 
difference in the metastatic preponderance in a high versus low sialyl Lewis(a) 
expression in the tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study in a randomized controlled trial suggests 
that sialyl Lewis(a) expression levels may serve as an indicator of the 
metastatic potential of colon cancer cells, which would strongly predict the 
prognosis."

Biological relevance of adduct detection to the chemoprevention of cancer.

"Adducts arise from the chemical modification of bases in DNA or amino acids in 
proteins by toxic chemicals. Many chemicals known to be carcinogenic in humans 
have been shown to form adducts or to cause oxidative damage to genomic DNA in 
model systems. Biomarkers of carcinogenesis reflect biological events that take 
place between exposure to external or endogenous carcinogens and the subsequent 
development of cancer. Therapeutic intervention for the purpose of cancer 
chemoprevention may modify these biomarkers. In this article, the potential 
efficacy of DNA adducts as biomarkers of carcinogenesis and chemoprevention is 
discussed using criteria defined for phases of biomarker development. The 
sensitivity of adduct detection in histologically normal tissue offers 
opportunities for the early detection of carcinogenesis. Extensive evidence for 
aflatoxin B(1) adducts as biomarkers of risk and progression of hepatic 
carcinogenesis and for oxidative DNA adducts as biomarkers of the development of 
prostate carcinogenesis is reviewed together with the clinical trials measuring 
these adducts as biomarkers of the efficacy of chemoprevention. Favorable 
modification of oxidative DNA adducts by dietary intervention and 
chemoprevention has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. 
Protein adducts and DNA adducts in blood constituents or urine may act as useful 
surrogates for the target organ. Additional information regarding reliability, 
reproducibility, specificity, and confounding variables are required at the 
clinical level to validate adducts as suitable biomarkers of chemoprevention.

beneficial effects in the 1940s, scientists have found molecules with greater 
selectivity to block specific histamine receptors without some of the 
detrimental side effects that are seen if antihistamines cross the blood-brain 
barrier. Levocetirizine is the active enantiomer of cetirizine and a selective 
H(1)-histamine blocker. It exhibits many favourable characteristics of an ideal 
antihistamine, both pharmacodynamically and pharmacokinetically, including high 
bioavailability, rapid onset of action, limited distribution and low degree of 
metabolism. Furthermore, clinical trials indicate that it is safe and effective 
for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria with a minimal 
amount of untoward effects."

"OBJECTIVE: To compare performance of students instructed by cooperative learning 
(CL) activities with those taught by lecture. A secondary objective was to 
assess students' perceptions about their ability to work in teams before and 
after their exposure to these instructional approaches.
DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: CL was incorporated into the immunology/serology 
course of a university-based clinical laboratory science (CLS) program. 
Twenty-two students participated in a 4-week study and were randomly assigned to 
one of two study groups.
INTERVENTION: One group received the course material by CL activities, and the 
other group was exposed to the material through lecture.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Mean examination scores for CL and lecture groups were 
compared using an independent samples t-test. Teamwork knowledge, skills, and 
attitude (KSA) assessment rated students' perceptions of their ability to work 
in a team environment pre and post tests were compared using a 2 x 2 repeated 
measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between mean examination scores of 
students who acquired their knowledge by CL activities (85.09%) and those taught 
by lecture (82.18%). Teamwork KSA means scores pre and post tests (22.5, 22.6 
CL; 22.7, 21.6 lecture) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the incorporation of CL activities did not 
reduce the students' academic performance or self-perceptions of their ability 
to work in teams. The use of CL in the classroom, student laboratory, or 
clinical setting may help prepare students for the role they will be expected to 
perform as laboratory professionals."

"Antibodies directed to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
O-antigens have clearly shown to mediate the most effective immunity to 
infection caused by LPS-smooth strains. Such strains are major causes of disease 
in immunocompromised hosts such as burn or cancer patients, individuals in 
intensive care units, and those who utilize extended-wear contact lenses. Yet 
producing an effective vaccine composed of non-toxic, immunogenic 
polysaccharides has been challenging. The chemical diversity among the different 
O-antigens representative of the 20 major serotypes, plus additional diversity 
among some O-antigens representing variant subtype antigens, translates into a 
large degree of serologic variability that increases the complexity of O-antigen 
specific vaccines. Further complications come from the poor immunogenicity of 
the major protective epitope expressed by some O-antigens, and a large degree of 
diversity in animal responses that preclude predicting the optimal vaccine 
formulation from such studies. Nonetheless human trials over the years of 
vaccines eliciting O-antigen immunity have been encouraging, though no vaccine 
has yet been fully evaluated and found to be clinically efficacious. Newer 
vaccine approaches such as using polysaccharide-protein conjugates and passive 
therapy with monoclonal or polyclonal immune sera offer some additional means to 
try and produce an effective immunotherapeutic reagent for this problematic 
pathogen."

"BACKGROUND: The authors assessed the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in 
patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using technetium-99m 
colloidal rhenium sulfide. They studied whether an analysis of sentinel lymph 
nodes using cytokeratin (CK) immunohistochemistry increased the accuracy of 
staging.
METHODS: The authors observed 25 patients with thoracic esophageal carcinomas 
who underwent radical esophagectomy. The day before surgery, technetium-99m 
colloidal rhenium sulfide was injected into the submucosa at four sites around 
the primary tumor. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed. Esophagectomy and regional 
lymph node dissection were performed 17 hours after the technetium-99m 
injection. After surgery, the resected lymph nodes were evaluated by CK 
staining.
RESULTS: Lymphoscintigraphy detected sentinel lymph nodes in 92% of the patients 
(23 of 25 patients). The accuracy of sentinel lymph node was 91.3% (21 of 23 
patients), the sensitivity was 86.7% (13 of 15 patients), and the false-negative 
rate was 8.7% (2 of 23 patients). A comparison of the number of sentinel lymph 
nodes and clinicopathologic factors showed that there was a significant 
association between the number of sentinel lymph nodes and lymph node status (P 
< 0.01), pathologic stage (P < 0.05), and the number of metastatic lymph nodes 
(P < 0.05). Occult metastasis was detected by CK staining in 14 (56%) of the 25 
patients and in 23 (1.7%) of 1406 lymph nodes. Because the 2 false-negative 
(sentinel lymph node-negative and nonsentinel lymph node-positive) patients who 
had occult metastases in the sentinel lymph nodes, the accuracy of sentinel 
lymph node evaluation using CK staining was 100% (23 of 23).
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic mapping with technetium-99m colloidal rhenium sulfide was 
used to identify the lymphatic basin and was feasible in patients with 
esophageal SCC. An analysis of sentinel lymph nodes using CK 
immunohistochemistry increased the accuracy of sentinel lymph node."

"We report 6-month results of renal allograft recipients enrolled in seven 
Australian centers as part of a worldwide, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 
concentration-controlled trial comparing standard tacrolimus (sTAC) with reduced 
tacrolimus (rTAC) both with sirolimus (SRL) and steroids. Patients were 
randomized 1:1 to either rTAC (n = 33) with a target maintenance concentration 
of SRL of 8 to 15 ng/mL and TAC of 3 to 7 ng/mL, or sTAC (n = 31) with SRL 
target of 5 to 10 ng/mL and TAC of 8 to 12 ng/mL. Antibody induction was 
prohibited. Adult recipients of a first or second cadaveric or non-HLA-identical 
living donor renal graft were eligible for enrollment. Recipients with a 
panel-reactive antibody level of >50% and recipients of regrafts who had lost 
their first graft from rejection within the first 6 months were ineligible. The 
groups were compared for graft function, incidence of rejection, and patient and 
graft survival at 6 months. There were no differences in demographics. There 
were 30% and 29% discontinuations in the rTAC and sTAC groups mainly due to 
adverse events in the first month. The 6-month patient and graft survival by 
intention-to-treat analysis was 94% and 91% for rTAC and 100% and 97% for sTAC 
(P = NS), respectively. Incidence and severity of biopsy-proven acute rejection 
was not different between the two groups, being 21% for rTAC and 19% for sTAC. 
The mean serum creatinine was 121 micromol/L and 148 micromol/L for rTAC and 
sTAC groups (P =.09), respectively. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 68 
mL/min and 62 mL/min (P =.23), respectively. Adverse events, infections, and 
antihypertensive and antilipidemic agent usage were similar. Of interest is that 
the overall incidence of thrombotic microangiopathy was 14%. These results 
support the safety and efficacy of SRL + TAC. Reduced TAC is associated with a 
trend toward improved renal function."

"Early in its development, the potency of Merck's recombinant hepatitis B 
vaccine, RECOMBIVAX HB, was monitored using an assay performed in mice. A 
specification was determined to be the lowest potency which induced acceptable 
response in clinical trials. As a post-licensing commitment, Merck was asked to 
replace its mouse potency assay with an in vitro procedure for product release 
in the US market. Early studies with a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) 
yielded highly variable results. That assay, combined with a sample pretreatment 
step, proved more dependable and predictive of potency in the mouse assay. Based 
on measurements made on manufactured materials, combined with experiments 
contrived to yield a wide range of reactivity in the two assays, concordance was 
established between the EIA and the mouse potency assay. This concordance was 
used to calibrate a specification for the in vitro assay that is predictive of a 
satisfactory response in vivo. Data from clinical trials established a 
correspondence between human immunogenicity and these potency markers."

"BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms associated with allergy and asthma cause 
substantial health care burden.
OBJECTIVE: This observational pilot study compared internal medicine/family 
practice (IM/FP) and pediatric primary care providers with allergists in the 
diagnosis, treatment, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes of 
adults and children with respiratory symptoms.
METHODS: Two allergists, 2 IM/FP, and 2 pediatricians enrolled 242 patients with 
respiratory symptoms ages 5 to 16 years old (n = 123) and 17 to 70 years old (n 
= 119). HRQL questionnaires were completed at enrollment and quarterly for 1 
year. The adult questionnaire included SF-36, respiratory symptom role 
productivity, ITG Asthma Short Form, and allergy symptom index (ASI) scales. The 
child questionnaire included CHQ-PF28, respiratory symptom family impact, ITG 
Child Asthma Short Form, and ASI scales. HRQL changes were evaluated over the 
study period.
RESULTS: Adults treated by allergists reported significantly greater improvement 
in HRQL on 5 of 8 SF-36 scales, the respiratory symptom role productivity scale, 
3 of 5 ITG Asthma Short Form scales, and 2 of 4 ASI scales compared with adults 
treated by an IM/FP (P < 0.05). Pediatric patients treated by allergists had 
significantly greater improvement on 3 of 15 CHQ-PF28 scales, the respiratory 
symptom family impact scale, and one ASI scale compared with patients treated by 
pediatricians (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients treated by primary care physicians, patients 
treated by allergists reported greater improvement in HRQL in a number of 
scales. Additional research is required to further evaluate the impact of 
provider specialty and patterns of care on outcomes of respiratory symptoms 
patients."

"Experiments were conducted in both sheep and humans to evaluate techniques for 
rapid sampling and measurement of testosterone, insulin, 17-beta estradiol, 
cortisol and glucose collected in saliva or transdermal exudate. Ultrasound and 
an electric current facilitated the latter collection. All but insulin were 
successfully measured in saliva, under resting conditions, and the measured 
hormones correlated best with blood levels 20-40 min prior to the saliva 
collection. With imposition of, and recovery from, an exercise stress, this 
correlation was weakened irrespective of considering the time lag between blood 
measures during this period and subsequent changes in saliva values. Provided an 
initial transdermal flux was established, all the hormones and glucose were 
successfully measured in the transdermal exudate at levels correlating with 
blood measures at the time of collection, and this held across stressor 
application and recovery. The transdermal exudate sampling and measurement 
apparatus is relatively portable, enabling noninvasive collection and analyte 
measurement, rapidly, at the site where the experiment is being conducted with 
minimal interference to subjects. This potentially offers a tool of considerable 
value to endocrine studies."

"The 14th European Immunology Meeting--EFIS 2000, held in Poznan, Poland on 23-27 
September 2000, was the last major meeting of European immunologists in the 
second millennium. This conference was intended to summarise past achievements 
and to present future prospects in immunology. The philosophy of the scientific 
program was to fuse fundamental and clinical immunology and give a chance for 
basic scientists and clinicians to discuss mutual topics in a general view. 
There were eight state-of-art lectures, 12 'meet an expert' sessions, 20 plenary 
sessions and 46 workshops. More than 900 works were presented. Significant 
interest was focused on several aspects of cancer immunology and immunotherapy. 
EFIS 2000 was accompanied by six pre-congress satellite symposia held in various 
Polish cities. The topics were, 'Heat shock proteins: immune, stress response 
and apoptosis' (Gdansk), 'Infectious immunity and vaccines' (Kazimierz Dolny), 
'Mononuclear phagocytes in basic and clinical immunology' (Cracow), 'Immunology 
of reproduction' (Poznan), 'Primary immunodeficiencies' (Warsaw) and

"HIV and malaria are two major infections that are responsible for the greatest 
burden of diseases, morbidity and mortality in the African population. 
Successful research has been undertaken in Africa into novel means of monitoring 
HIV disease progression and in identifying vaccine candidates. The role of IgG 
isotypes in malaria has been investigated, as have parasite adhesion molecules 
important for pathogenesis. It is hoped that vaccines for malaria will soon 
prove successful. However, many problems still face immunology research in 
Africa."

"Rapid on-site tests for the analysis of drugs of abuse in unconventional 
specimens (e.g., sweat) have recently been developed. Two healthy volunteers 
familiar with the effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) were given 100 
mg of the drug as a single oral dose. MDMA and its main metabolite 
4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) were determined in plasma and urine by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MDMA was also investigated in 
sweat with the Drugwipe (an immunochemical strip test). Subjects' armpits were 
swabbed for 10 s at 0 time (predose) and at 2, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after MDMA 
administration. MDMA consumption could be detected using Drugwipe at 2 h and for 
as long as 12 h after drug administration. However, in one of the volunteers, a 
faint color change appeared at 0 time, when plasma and urine tested negative for 
MDMA and did not disappear even 48 h later. Plasma concentrations of MDMA and 
HMMA measured by GC-MS peaked at 2-4 h, and values greater than 20 ng/mL for 
MDMA and of 40 ng/mL for HMMA were still detected at 24 h. Urine tested positive 
by GC-MS for MDMA and HMMA in the 48-h collection period. These findings 
preliminarily support sweat testing with Drugwipe for monitoring MDMA use."

"BACKGROUND: Potent allergens such as hymenoptera venoms are capable of inducing 
severe and life threatening clinical reactions. Percentage of false negative 
results obtained by the usual diagnostical methods is comprised between 10 and 
25%.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the sensitivity and the specificity of cellular tests 
and particularly evaluation of a new flow cytometric method.
METHODS: Forty-five allergic patients having experienced a local, a systemic 
reaction or an anaphylactic shock and 10 controls having undergone hymenoptera 
stings without clinical reactions were selected on the basis of the clinical 
history, skin tests and specific IgE. Three cellular tests were performed on the 
same cell suspensions and in the presence of 2 ng/mL of rIL3: histamine release 
(RIA), leukotriene C4 release (ELISA) and basophil activation test (flow 
cytometry after double anti-IgE FITC, anti-CD63 PE labelling).
RESULTS: As compared to the clinical history, sensitivities of skin tests, 
specific IgE, flow cytometry, histamine release and leukotriene release were, 
respectively; 85%, 88%, 100%, 89% and 100%. Flow cytometric analysis of basophil 
activation showed a significant decrease of the mean fluorescence density and 
number of IgE positive cells and a significant increase of the number of CD63 
positive cells. The 10 controls tested by flow cytometry were negative.
CONCLUSION: As compared to the clinical history and to the other parameters 
tested here, flow cytometry showed a high sensitivity and a high specificity. 
The excellent correlation observed between this method and the other cellular 
tests such as histamine and leukotriene release are in favour of the specificity 
of flow cytomery and in favour of the use of this method for venom allergy 
diagnosis."

"Rozen P(1), Knaani J, Samuel Z."
"Author information:

Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."
"BACKGROUND: HemoccultSENSA (HOS), the sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood test 
(FOBT) for colorectal neoplasia, is faulted for its low specificity, which might 
be improved by substituting or adding FlexSure OBT (FS), the immunochemical test 
for human hemoglobin. (Both tests are manufactured by Beckman-Coulter Inc., 
Primary Care Diagnostics, Palo Alto, CA.) The authors compared both FOBTs in an 
endoscopic study to determine which FOBT to recommend for a population-screening 
program.
METHODS: Both FOBTs, without dietary restrictions, were prepared by 1410 
screenees or nonbleeding symptomatic patients (3%). All underwent colonoscopy 
(51.8%) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (if asymptomatic and both FOBTs were 
negative).
RESULTS: HOS sensitivity for significant neoplasia, cancers, or adenomas >/= 1 
cm (20 cases) was similar to that of FS (50% vs. 35%, not significant). However, 
HOS specificity was lower (95% vs. 99%, confidence interval (CIs) 94-96 vs. 
98-99, P < 0.05). In those 11 cases in which both HOS and FS were positive, 
specificity for significant neoplasia was 100% but sensitivity decreased to 25% 
(less than HOS alone, P < 0.05). HOS was more sensitive than FS for any 
neoplasia (55 cases), including adenomas < 1 cm (35% vs. 18%, CIs 22-47 vs. 
8-28, P < 0.05), but less specific (96% vs. 99%, CIs 95-97 vs. 98-100, P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Guaiac HOS, which does not require dietary restrictions, is 
significantly more sensitive for any colorectal neoplasm than the immunochemical 
FS; it identifies more adenomas with a specificity that is low but acceptable 
for population screening."

"In this study TIBC and serum-transferrin concentrations were determined by 
immunochemical turbidimetry, immunochemical nephelometry and radial 
immunodiffusion under normal and pathological clinical conditions. A total of 
246 (123 male/123 female) patients were included [iron deficiency: 60 (18/42), 
iron overload: 56 (39/17), chronic inflammation: 47 (23/24), undefined diseases: 
35 (16/19), healthy volunteers 48 (27/21)]. The data show that determination of 
TIBC from conversion of transferrin values using a constant factor results in 
significantly higher values compared to conversion with a function of first 
degree. For clinical practice the influence of different diseases is negligible. 
This study indicates that it is not possible to develop a universal algorithm 
for the conversion of transferrin values into TIBC."

"A new method for in vitro chemosensitivity testing of human lymphoma and 
leukemia patients has been developed. The method is based on the use of 
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a universal marker of proliferation, which is 
expressed early during the cell cycle and has a short half-life. This marker was 
detected by a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, using an ODC antibody 
and a FITC-linked second antibody. The in vitro chemosensitivity of lymphocytes 
from four normal individuals was tested by the immunohistochemical method. 
Lymphocytes from 25 cancer patients were also examined. In drug-sensitive cells, 
the intensity of the marker declined in the presence of the drug, whereas 
resistance to the drug was demonstrated by the presence of the marker. A good 
correlation was found between the predicted chemosensitivity and the outcome of 
the therapy. It has been suggested that this approach could be used for in vitro 
chemosensitivity testing of hematological cancers and most likely also for other 
malignancies."

0.5 mg oral dose of digoxin elixir. The pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin 
(AUC0-->24' AUC0-->infinity' Cmax' tmax' t1/2) and cumulative urinary excretion 
over 120 hours were not affected by the multiple doses of montelukast. The 90% 
confidence interval for each of these parameters fell within prespecified 
clinically acceptable bounds. Side effects were mild and transient. This 
suggests that concurrent administration of montelukast and digoxin was well 
tolerated. Concurrent treatment with montelukast has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin."

"Tissue injury results in the release of the intracellular protein actin which is 
cleared from the circulation by the plasma proteins gelsolin and Gc-globulin, 
constituting the Extracellular Actin Scavenger System (EASS). Experimental 
studies have shown that excessive amounts of actin in the circulation can lead 
to a condition resembling multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and we 
have previously demonstrated that the level of Gc-globulin is decreased after 
severe trauma. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the 
plasma levels of gelsolin were altered in the early phase after trauma. 
Twenty-three consecutive trauma patients were studied. Plasma samples were 
assayed for gelsolin by immunonephelometry with polyclonal rabbit antihuman 
gelsolin prepared in our own laboratory. The median time from injury until the 
time the first blood sample was taken was 52 min (range 20-110) and the median 
Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 20 (range 4-50). The gelsolin level on admission 
was reduced significantly in the trauma patients compared with normal controls. 
The median level was 51 mg/L (7-967) vs. 207 mg/L (151-621), P < 0.0001. There 
was no correlation between admission levels of gelsolin and ISS or survival. 
This study illustrates that the plasma concentration of gelsolin is 
significantly diminished immediately after traumatic injury. Further studies are 
necessary to establish a role for gelsolin or EASS in the development of MODS in 
trauma patients. The level of serum or plasma gelsolin can be determined rapidly 
and accurately using a nephelometric assay."

"Adhesion molecules, such as Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), play an 
important role during the autoimmune process of Graves' disease (GD). So the 
objective of the study was to evaluate the time-course of the soluble ICAM-1 
(sICAM-1) in GD. Concentrations of sICAM-1, thyroid hormones and TSAb 
(thyroid-stimulating antibodies) were determined in sera from 30 healthy 
controls, 41 untreated GD patients and after 3, 6, 12, 18 months of carbimazole 
therapy (no.=30), at relapse (no.=11) or 2 years after the end of therapy when 
remission (no.=13). Mean sICAM-1 concentration was significantly higher in 
untreated GD patients than in controls (mean+/-SD: 371+/-108 ng/ml vs 243+/-47 
ng/ml, p<0.0001) until 6 months of therapy (289+/-102 ng/ml; NS). The number of 
positive patients (sICAM-1 levels>mean of the controls+2 SD) declined from 56% 
(23/41) at the time of the diagnosis to 10% (3/29) at 18 months. At relapse, 
mean sICAM-1 level significantly increased compared to that at 18 months of 
therapy (288+/-65 vs 236+/-59 ng/ml, p=0.005). At remission mean sICAM-1 level 
was significantly lower than in relapse patients (240+/-48 ng/ml, p=0.04); no 
patient displayed sICAM-1 positive values. In conclusion, sICAM-1 concentrations 
were increased in sera of newly diagnosed GD patients, declined significantly 
during carbimazole therapy and could again be increased at relapse. sICAM-1 
could reflect an ongoing immune process and help to affirm the presence of an 
autoimmunity notably in some cases of TSAb negative patients. However its 
precise interest in clinical practice remains to be determined in further 
studies."

"We explored simultaneously 14-3-3 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and 
one astroglial protein, S-100, recently proposed as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease 
(CJD) markers, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 129 patients with suspected 
CJD. Cutoff values for NSE and S-100 were established at 25 and 2.5 ng/ml, 
respectively. The highest sensitivity was observed for S-100 (94.2%) followed by 
14-3-3 (89.8%) and NSE (79.7%), while the highest specificity in CJD diagnosis 
was obtained with 14-3-3 protein (100%) as compared with NSE (91.5%) and S-100 
(85.4%). No influence of sex, genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene, 
time between sampling, and death or disease duration has been found. Based on 90 
cases initially referred as 'probable' or 'possible' CJD, with 14-3-3, NSE, or 
S-100 we could correctly discriminate between 'CJD' or 'non-CJD' categories in 
94.4, 86.5, and 90% of the cases, respectively. When limited to 'possible CJD' 
cases, diagnosis based on one of the three CSF proteins was accurate in 98, 90.7 
and 87.3%, respectively. In view of the fact that the CSF 14-3-3 protein test 
alone has the highest specificity and good sensitivity, it appears that there is 
no additional advantage at the moment to include NSE and/or S-100 protein in the 
exploration of clinically suspected CJD cases."

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection plays a central role in the 
pathogenesis of mixed cryoglobulinemia through molecular mechanisms which remain 
to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of antibody 
responses to HCV in the pathogenesis of cryoglobulinemia through 
characterization of the anti-HCV specificity and immunochemical characteristics 
of the immunoglobulins involved in cryoprecipitation.
METHODS: Sera from 50 consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection (RNA 
positive) were screened for the presence of cryoglobulins. The two major 
components of cryoprecipitates, IgM rheumatoid factors and IgG, were separated 
by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed for immunochemical 
composition by immunoblotting and antibody specificity by ELISA and 
immunoblotting using recombinant HCV proteins and synthetic peptides as 
antigens.
RESULTS: Cryoprecipitates were observed in 27 patients and characterized by 
immunofixation: 13 (48%) were classified as type II and 14 (52%) as type III. 
Monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected by immunoblotting in 20 
cryoprecipitates: IgM in 14 samples and IgG in 14, with a clear preponderance of 
IgG3 (12/14). Specificity studies on sera and purified IgM and IgG fractions 
from cryoprecipitates revealed enrichment in cryoglobulins, predominantly 
polyclonal IgG1, reactive with the HCV structural proteins, whereas 
specificities for nonstructural viral proteins were relatively less represented 
compared to whole serum. No restricted pattern of fine specificity was observed. 
IgG3 subclass was apparently not involved in HCV nucleoprotein binding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a direct link between monoclonal 
cryoglobulins and immune response to HCV According to the proposed pathogenetic 
model, HCV infection can induce the formation of cryoprecipitable rheumatoid 
factors, sustain their production, and eventually lead to monoclonal B-cell 
expansion through several cooperative mechanisms."

"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between patients' systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) activity and physicians' decision to treat with steroids or 
alternative medication.
METHODS: Baseline information and clinical status was extracted from case 
histories of 30 patients with lupus and represented in clinical vignettes. These 
vignettes were then mailed to 60 physicians (rheumatologists and immunologists 
with experience in the treatment of lupus), asking them in each case whether 
they would initiate treatment or not. The relationship between the 38 complete 
responses and the SLE Activity Measure (SLAM-R) and SLE Disease Activity Index 
(SLEDAI) lupus activity scores was analyzed using a general additive model.
RESULTS: SLE disease activity measured by SLAM-R or SLEDAI is a significant 
predictor (p < 0.0001) of physicians' decision to initiate treatment for 
patients with lupus. Variation between physicians was observed but was mostly 
due to a few outliers. Some other variations remained unexplained by patients' 
SLE disease activity, damage, or by specific organ involvement.
CONCLUSION: We present reference tables and curves for research that may be used 
as a basis to derive standardized quantitative criteria for entry in clinical 
trials. More research is needed on how these tools can be used by clinicians to 
guide them in their decision to treat or not."

"High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (hdIVIg) is increasingly used to treat a 
range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The current dermatological uses 
of hdIVIg include the treatment of dermatomyositis and the autoimmune bullous 
disorders, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, pemphigoid, and pemphigus. Numerous 
immunomodulatory mechanisms for hdIVIg have been proposed, and they are 
discussed alongside treatment protocols and adverse effects. Increasing use of 
this therapy has helped to establish its excellent safety record, without the 
many adverse effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. This safety 
record makes hdIVIg an attractive therapeutic option; however, in view of the 
time required to administer the infusions, the cost, and the urgent need for 
controlled trials of hdIVIg in patients with specific dermatological disorders 
such as pemphigus, patients must be carefully selected. Unfortunately, current 
dermatological uses of hdIVIg have been limited to either uncontrolled trials or 
anecdotal case reports, except for a single controlled trial of hdIVIg as 
adjunctive therapy in patients with dermatomyositis, which documented a 
significant benefit. Further trials in dermatomyositis should be established to 
confirm these data and to clarify the dose and frequency of therapy required for 
patients with dermatomyositis. When using hdIVIg, liaison between the 
dermatologist and the immunologist is helpful because it allows the use of both 
the nursing and the medical expertise of an existing immunotherapy unit. If 
appropriate, the patient may be entered into an hdIVIg home therapy training 
program, such as the one that exists for primary immunodeficiency and some 
neurologic indications, with clear benefits in quality of life and inpatient 
costs."

"Exposure chambers have proven to be valuable tools in studying allergic 
diseases. The chamber provides a controlled environment and maintains conditions 
for measuring the amount of allergen inducing symptoms in allergic subjects. The 
aim of the present study was to develop and test an exposure chamber. The 
chamber was constructed as an airtight tent, made of transparent polyethylene, 
easy to adapt to the shape of an existing room, easy to clean, and providing 
exact allergen-dosage control. Airflow to the interior of the tent was 
controlled by a variable inlet ventilator fitted with a micropore filter and 
balanced by a variable high-volume air-sampler on the outlet side. Trace 
material and allergen were administered as aerosols with a nebulizer connected 
to the inlet pipe. Samples were obtained from interior surfaces and filters at 
the outlet. Two different methods were used to test the concept. One method used 
a colored, neutral trace substance (phenol red indicator) measured 
photometrically on extracts from filters. Secondly, house-dust mite allergen 
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) was applied, with samples analyzed by an ELISA 
technique. The results demonstrated the ability of the system to administer and 
sample allergen with a high degree of reproducibility. A clinical pilot trial 
proved the capability of the system to initiate symptoms in allergic subjects."

"A monoclonal antibody against 5-methylcytidine was prepared and characterized. 
This antibody, termed AMC, was reactive with compounds that had 5-methylcytosine 
structure (i.e. 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-methylcytidine and 
5-methylcytosine). AMC had the highest reactivity to 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine 
among reactive compounds and had no or very slight cross-reactivity to 
cytidine-related compounds and any other compounds. Analysis of immunoreactive 
materials in urine revealed that 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine rather than 
5-methylcytidine was, contrary to our expectation, the major component. Then the 
inhibition ELISA system using AMC was established and urinary levels of 
5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in healthy individuals and cancer patients were 
determined. The mean excretion levels of healthy individuals was 0.90 +/- 0.43 
nmol/mumol creatinine and the cut-off value was set at the mean + 2 S.D. of 
healthy individuals (1.76 nmol/mumol creatinine). Among various types of cancer 
tested, elevated levels of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine were detected in leukemia 
patients. From these results, urinary 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine might be 
applicable as a biologic marker for leukemia."

The role of complement in anti-bacterial defence.
"D'Amelio R(1), Biselli R."
"Author information:
(1)Laboratorio di Immunologia, Aeroporto Pratica di Mare, Roma."
"The complement system consists of several proteins present in human serum 
interacting among themselves and with the other compounds of the immune system 
in the host defence process. In particular, late complement component (C5, C6, 
C7, and C8) deficiencies (LCCD) are closely associated with Neisseria, mainly 
meningitidis, infections. The aim of our study was to verify this association in 
an Italian population by analyzing the complement profile in survivors of 
meningococcal meningitis. Ten out of the 59 (17%) subjects studied had 
homozygous LCCD (6 C8, 3 C7 and 1 C6). The meningococcal C strain was the most 
widely diffused (68%) and had infected all homozygous LCCD subjects. In addition 
meningococcal serogroup C seemed to be the least immunogenic when compared to 
serogroups A and B. These data confirm the close association between homozygous 
LCCD and meningococcal infections from common serogroups (A, B and C) in the 
Italian population. Anti-meningococcal vaccination is usually recommended for 
LCCD subjects because it increases, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the 
antibody component of anti-meningococcal immune defence. We therefore analyzed 
the levels of anti-polysaccharide (PS) A and PSC antibodies in the members of 4 
families including normal subjects and subjects with homozygous and heterozygous 
C7, C8 or factor H defects, before and after vaccination with only PSA+C. 
Surprisingly, we found the highest levels of antibodies before vaccination in 
homozygous subjects, followed by heterozygous and normal controls, whereas, 
after vaccination, homozygous subjects showed the lowest increase of specific 
antibodies, indicating their relative incapacity to respond to meningococcal PS 
alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

normalization of these parameters after therapy. The normalization correlated 
with clinical improvement in patients with endogenous depression. The course

The effect of grenz rays on irritant skin reactions in man.
"Lindelöf B, Lindberg M."
"To investigate the effect of grenz rays on irritant contact reactions, eleven 
healthy volunteers were studied. They were given 3 Gy of grenz rays, once a week 
for 3 weeks, to a defined area of the back. Twenty-four hours after the last 
treatment, serial dilution sodium lauryl sulphate patch tests were applied both 
on the grenz ray treated area and on the untreated control skin. Biopsy 
specimens were taken from the irritant reactions both from the grenz ray treated 
area and from the control area and different cell populations in dermis and 
epidermis were identified by monoclonal antibodies (Leu 2, 3, 4, 7, Leu M1, B1, 
OKT6). In the grenz ray treated epidermis there was a pronounced reduction of 
OKT6-positive cells but the composition of the dermal cellular infiltrate did 
not differ between control and grenz ray treated skin. The assessment of the 
patch test reactions did reveal a tendency towards weaker reactions in the grenz 
ray pre-treated skin but this difference was not statistically significant. It 
is concluded that grenz rays do not have a marked effect on the elicitation of 
irritant reactions."

Steroid hormone receptors as prognostic indicators in primary breast cancer.

"Recurrence-free survival (RFS) has been evaluated with regard to estrogen and 
progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) status for 145 postmenopausal women with 
primary breast cancer at high risk for recurrent disease. All patients received 
only local-regional therapy as an adjuvant therapy (DBCG protocol 77-c 
patients). ER+ patients had a significantly longer RFS than ER-patients. This 
difference was apparent using a cut-off level of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein to 
distinguish between ER+ and ER-patients. There was no apparent difference in 
patients with high (greater than = 100 fmol/mg cytosol protein) ER levels vs. 
those with intermediate (10-99 fmol/mg cytosol protein) levels, indicating that 
the prognostic value of ER determinations in the natural course of the disease 
resides in a qualitative rather than a quantitative distinction among patients. 
No difference in RFS was found patients when patient were subdivided according 
to PgR status. The clinical applicability of the ER-ICA assay method for ER 
determinations is demonstrated in a subset of patients, some of whom received 
adjuvant endocrine therapy."

cross-reactivity with benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, and cefotaxime. Aztreonam 
likewise displayed negligible cross-reactivity (less than or equal to 0.001%) 
with antibodies to penicillin (including human IgE antibodies to major and minor 
penicillin determinants) and to cephalothin. These studies suggest that 
aztreonam may be well tolerated by penicillin-allergic individuals, and this 
possibly is now being evaluated in clinical trials. Seven (6.25%) of 112 healthy 
persons tested had preexisting IgG antibodies to aztreonam in low titer, 
presumably as a result of exposure to naturally occurring cross-reacting 
moieties. Only two of seven patients with preexisting IgG antibodies to 
aztreonam had a rise in titer following aztreonam treatment. No IgE antibody to 
aztreonam was detected in serum specimens obtained on day 10 during any of the 
112 courses of therapy. These clinical observations suggest but do not prove 
that aztreonam has only weak potential to elicit a drug-specific immunologic 
response."

"Immunostimulants are chemical substances capable of increasing the overall 
activity of a normal immune system as well as normalizing the function of an 
impaired immune system (immune restauration). This review is concerned with 
substances of microbial or chemical origin and excludes the so-called 
physiological inductors or regulators, e.g. thymic factors, interferon etc. 
During the last decade considerable progress has been achieved with respect to 
the isolation of effective compounds and the elucidation of their chemical 
structure. However, the knowledge of their mechanism of action and their effects 
in the living organism is still poor because of the complexity of the immune 
system, lack of appropriate standardization methods, lack of internationally 
agreed test conditions or diseases in intact animals or conditions for 
controlled clinical trials in man."
