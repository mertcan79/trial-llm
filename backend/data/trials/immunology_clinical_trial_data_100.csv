"BACKGROUND: The metastatic potential of tumors is dependent on the cell to cell 
adhesion by cell surface carbohydrate antigens. Thus, expression of sialyl 
Lewis(a), which is one of the important molecules of cell surface carbohydrates, 
may serve as a prognostic marker of aggressive and metastasizing tumor growth. 
However, the prognostic value of sialyl Lewis(a) expression in colon cancer is 
still controversial.
METHODS: In this study, we investigated the expression of sialyl Lewis(a) 
antigen in 233 colon cancer specimens from patients who were registered in a 
prospective adjuvant immunochemotherapy clinical trial. The clinical course and 
the prognosis of the patients were evaluated after all the immunohistochemical 
analyses had been performed.
RESULTS: Sialyl Lewis(a) expression levels were correlated with both overall 
survival (P = 0.0006) and disease-free survival (P = 0.004) in all patients with 
the log-rank test. This result could be assumed to have been influenced by the 
difference in the metastatic preponderance in a high versus low sialyl Lewis(a) 
expression in the tumor cells.
CONCLUSION: This prospective study in a randomized controlled trial suggests 
that sialyl Lewis(a) expression levels may serve as an indicator of the 
metastatic potential of colon cancer cells, which would strongly predict the 
prognosis."

"Adducts arise from the chemical modification of bases in DNA or amino acids in 
proteins by toxic chemicals. Many chemicals known to be carcinogenic in humans 
have been shown to form adducts or to cause oxidative damage to genomic DNA in 
model systems. Biomarkers of carcinogenesis reflect biological events that take 
place between exposure to external or endogenous carcinogens and the subsequent 
development of cancer. Therapeutic intervention for the purpose of cancer 
chemoprevention may modify these biomarkers. In this article, the potential 
efficacy of DNA adducts as biomarkers of carcinogenesis and chemoprevention is 
discussed using criteria defined for phases of biomarker development. The 
sensitivity of adduct detection in histologically normal tissue offers 
opportunities for the early detection of carcinogenesis. Extensive evidence for 
aflatoxin B(1) adducts as biomarkers of risk and progression of hepatic 
carcinogenesis and for oxidative DNA adducts as biomarkers of the development of 
prostate carcinogenesis is reviewed together with the clinical trials measuring 
these adducts as biomarkers of the efficacy of chemoprevention. Favorable 
modification of oxidative DNA adducts by dietary intervention and 
chemoprevention has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. 
Protein adducts and DNA adducts in blood constituents or urine may act as useful 
surrogates for the target organ. Additional information regarding reliability, 
reproducibility, specificity, and confounding variables are required at the 
clinical level to validate adducts as suitable biomarkers of chemoprevention.

"Antihistamines are the cornerstone of treatment for many allergic diseases, such 
as allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria. Since the discovery of their 
beneficial effects in the 1940s, scientists have found molecules with greater 
selectivity to block specific histamine receptors without some of the 
detrimental side effects that are seen if antihistamines cross the blood-brain 
barrier. Levocetirizine is the active enantiomer of cetirizine and a selective 
H(1)-histamine blocker. It exhibits many favourable characteristics of an ideal 
antihistamine, both pharmacodynamically and pharmacokinetically, including high 
bioavailability, rapid onset of action, limited distribution and low degree of 
metabolism. Furthermore, clinical trials indicate that it is safe and effective 
for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria with a minimal 
amount of untoward effects."

"OBJECTIVE: To compare performance of students instructed by cooperative learning 
(CL) activities with those taught by lecture. A secondary objective was to 
assess students' perceptions about their ability to work in teams before and 
after their exposure to these instructional approaches.
DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: CL was incorporated into the immunology/serology 
course of a university-based clinical laboratory science (CLS) program. 
Twenty-two students participated in a 4-week study and were randomly assigned to 
one of two study groups.
INTERVENTION: One group received the course material by CL activities, and the 
other group was exposed to the material through lecture.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Mean examination scores for CL and lecture groups were 
compared using an independent samples t-test. Teamwork knowledge, skills, and 
attitude (KSA) assessment rated students' perceptions of their ability to work 
in a team environment pre and post tests were compared using a 2 x 2 repeated 
measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: No significant difference was found between mean examination scores of 
students who acquired their knowledge by CL activities (85.09%) and those taught 
by lecture (82.18%). Teamwork KSA means scores pre and post tests (22.5, 22.6 
CL; 22.7, 21.6 lecture) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the incorporation of CL activities did not 
reduce the students' academic performance or self-perceptions of their ability 
to work in teams. The use of CL in the classroom, student laboratory, or 
clinical setting may help prepare students for the role they will be expected to 
perform as laboratory professionals."

"Antibodies directed to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
O-antigens have clearly shown to mediate the most effective immunity to 
infection caused by LPS-smooth strains. Such strains are major causes of disease 
in immunocompromised hosts such as burn or cancer patients, individuals in 
intensive care units, and those who utilize extended-wear contact lenses. Yet 
producing an effective vaccine composed of non-toxic, immunogenic 
polysaccharides has been challenging. The chemical diversity among the different 
O-antigens representative of the 20 major serotypes, plus additional diversity 
among some O-antigens representing variant subtype antigens, translates into a 
large degree of serologic variability that increases the complexity of O-antigen 
specific vaccines. Further complications come from the poor immunogenicity of 
the major protective epitope expressed by some O-antigens, and a large degree of 
diversity in animal responses that preclude predicting the optimal vaccine 
formulation from such studies. Nonetheless human trials over the years of 
vaccines eliciting O-antigen immunity have been encouraging, though no vaccine 
has yet been fully evaluated and found to be clinically efficacious. Newer 
vaccine approaches such as using polysaccharide-protein conjugates and passive 
therapy with monoclonal or polyclonal immune sera offer some additional means to 
try and produce an effective immunotherapeutic reagent for this problematic 
pathogen."

"BACKGROUND: The authors assessed the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in 
patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using technetium-99m 
colloidal rhenium sulfide. They studied whether an analysis of sentinel lymph 
nodes using cytokeratin (CK) immunohistochemistry increased the accuracy of 
staging.
METHODS: The authors observed 25 patients with thoracic esophageal carcinomas 
who underwent radical esophagectomy. The day before surgery, technetium-99m 
colloidal rhenium sulfide was injected into the submucosa at four sites around 
the primary tumor. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed. Esophagectomy and regional 
lymph node dissection were performed 17 hours after the technetium-99m 
injection. After surgery, the resected lymph nodes were evaluated by CK 
staining.
RESULTS: Lymphoscintigraphy detected sentinel lymph nodes in 92% of the patients 
(23 of 25 patients). The accuracy of sentinel lymph node was 91.3% (21 of 23 
patients), the sensitivity was 86.7% (13 of 15 patients), and the false-negative 
rate was 8.7% (2 of 23 patients). A comparison of the number of sentinel lymph 
nodes and clinicopathologic factors showed that there was a significant 
association between the number of sentinel lymph nodes and lymph node status (P 
< 0.01), pathologic stage (P < 0.05), and the number of metastatic lymph nodes 
(P < 0.05). Occult metastasis was detected by CK staining in 14 (56%) of the 25 
patients and in 23 (1.7%) of 1406 lymph nodes. Because the 2 false-negative 
(sentinel lymph node-negative and nonsentinel lymph node-positive) patients who 
had occult metastases in the sentinel lymph nodes, the accuracy of sentinel 
lymph node evaluation using CK staining was 100% (23 of 23).
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic mapping with technetium-99m colloidal rhenium sulfide was 
used to identify the lymphatic basin and was feasible in patients with 
esophageal SCC. An analysis of sentinel lymph nodes using CK 
immunohistochemistry increased the accuracy of sentinel lymph node."

"We report 6-month results of renal allograft recipients enrolled in seven 
Australian centers as part of a worldwide, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 
concentration-controlled trial comparing standard tacrolimus (sTAC) with reduced 
tacrolimus (rTAC) both with sirolimus (SRL) and steroids. Patients were 
randomized 1:1 to either rTAC (n = 33) with a target maintenance concentration 
of SRL of 8 to 15 ng/mL and TAC of 3 to 7 ng/mL, or sTAC (n = 31) with SRL 
target of 5 to 10 ng/mL and TAC of 8 to 12 ng/mL. Antibody induction was 
prohibited. Adult recipients of a first or second cadaveric or non-HLA-identical 
living donor renal graft were eligible for enrollment. Recipients with a 
panel-reactive antibody level of >50% and recipients of regrafts who had lost 
their first graft from rejection within the first 6 months were ineligible. The 
groups were compared for graft function, incidence of rejection, and patient and 
graft survival at 6 months. There were no differences in demographics. There 
were 30% and 29% discontinuations in the rTAC and sTAC groups mainly due to 
adverse events in the first month. The 6-month patient and graft survival by 
intention-to-treat analysis was 94% and 91% for rTAC and 100% and 97% for sTAC 
(P = NS), respectively. Incidence and severity of biopsy-proven acute rejection 
was not different between the two groups, being 21% for rTAC and 19% for sTAC. 
The mean serum creatinine was 121 micromol/L and 148 micromol/L for rTAC and 
sTAC groups (P =.09), respectively. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 68 
mL/min and 62 mL/min (P =.23), respectively. Adverse events, infections, and 
antihypertensive and antilipidemic agent usage were similar. Of interest is that 
the overall incidence of thrombotic microangiopathy was 14%. These results 
support the safety and efficacy of SRL + TAC. Reduced TAC is associated with a 
trend toward improved renal function."

"Early in its development, the potency of Merck's recombinant hepatitis B 
vaccine, RECOMBIVAX HB, was monitored using an assay performed in mice. A 
specification was determined to be the lowest potency which induced acceptable 
response in clinical trials. As a post-licensing commitment, Merck was asked to 
replace its mouse potency assay with an in vitro procedure for product release 
in the US market. Early studies with a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) 
yielded highly variable results. That assay, combined with a sample pretreatment 
step, proved more dependable and predictive of potency in the mouse assay. Based 
on measurements made on manufactured materials, combined with experiments 
contrived to yield a wide range of reactivity in the two assays, concordance was 
established between the EIA and the mouse potency assay. This concordance was 
used to calibrate a specification for the in vitro assay that is predictive of a 
satisfactory response in vivo. Data from clinical trials established a 
correspondence between human immunogenicity and these potency markers."

"BACKGROUND: Respiratory symptoms associated with allergy and asthma cause 
substantial health care burden.
OBJECTIVE: This observational pilot study compared internal medicine/family 
practice (IM/FP) and pediatric primary care providers with allergists in the 
diagnosis, treatment, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes of 
adults and children with respiratory symptoms.
METHODS: Two allergists, 2 IM/FP, and 2 pediatricians enrolled 242 patients with 
respiratory symptoms ages 5 to 16 years old (n = 123) and 17 to 70 years old (n 
= 119). HRQL questionnaires were completed at enrollment and quarterly for 1 
year. The adult questionnaire included SF-36, respiratory symptom role 
productivity, ITG Asthma Short Form, and allergy symptom index (ASI) scales. The 
child questionnaire included CHQ-PF28, respiratory symptom family impact, ITG 
Child Asthma Short Form, and ASI scales. HRQL changes were evaluated over the 
study period.
RESULTS: Adults treated by allergists reported significantly greater improvement 
in HRQL on 5 of 8 SF-36 scales, the respiratory symptom role productivity scale, 
3 of 5 ITG Asthma Short Form scales, and 2 of 4 ASI scales compared with adults 
treated by an IM/FP (P < 0.05). Pediatric patients treated by allergists had 
significantly greater improvement on 3 of 15 CHQ-PF28 scales, the respiratory 
symptom family impact scale, and one ASI scale compared with patients treated by 
pediatricians (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients treated by primary care physicians, patients 
treated by allergists reported greater improvement in HRQL in a number of 
scales. Additional research is required to further evaluate the impact of 
provider specialty and patterns of care on outcomes of respiratory symptoms 
patients."

"Experiments were conducted in both sheep and humans to evaluate techniques for 
rapid sampling and measurement of testosterone, insulin, 17-beta estradiol, 
cortisol and glucose collected in saliva or transdermal exudate. Ultrasound and 
an electric current facilitated the latter collection. All but insulin were 
successfully measured in saliva, under resting conditions, and the measured 
hormones correlated best with blood levels 20-40 min prior to the saliva 
collection. With imposition of, and recovery from, an exercise stress, this 
correlation was weakened irrespective of considering the time lag between blood 
measures during this period and subsequent changes in saliva values. Provided an 
initial transdermal flux was established, all the hormones and glucose were 
successfully measured in the transdermal exudate at levels correlating with 
blood measures at the time of collection, and this held across stressor 
application and recovery. The transdermal exudate sampling and measurement 
apparatus is relatively portable, enabling noninvasive collection and analyte 
measurement, rapidly, at the site where the experiment is being conducted with 
minimal interference to subjects. This potentially offers a tool of considerable 
value to endocrine studies."

"The 14th European Immunology Meeting--EFIS 2000, held in Poznan, Poland on 23-27 
September 2000, was the last major meeting of European immunologists in the 
second millennium. This conference was intended to summarise past achievements 
and to present future prospects in immunology. The philosophy of the scientific 
program was to fuse fundamental and clinical immunology and give a chance for 
basic scientists and clinicians to discuss mutual topics in a general view. 
There were eight state-of-art lectures, 12 'meet an expert' sessions, 20 plenary 
sessions and 46 workshops. More than 900 works were presented. Significant 
interest was focused on several aspects of cancer immunology and immunotherapy. 
EFIS 2000 was accompanied by six pre-congress satellite symposia held in various 
Polish cities. The topics were, 'Heat shock proteins: immune, stress response 
and apoptosis' (Gdansk), 'Infectious immunity and vaccines' (Kazimierz Dolny), 
'Mononuclear phagocytes in basic and clinical immunology' (Cracow), 'Immunology 
of reproduction' (Poznan), 'Primary immunodeficiencies' (Warsaw) and

"HIV and malaria are two major infections that are responsible for the greatest 
burden of diseases, morbidity and mortality in the African population. 
Successful research has been undertaken in Africa into novel means of monitoring 
HIV disease progression and in identifying vaccine candidates. The role of IgG 
isotypes in malaria has been investigated, as have parasite adhesion molecules 
important for pathogenesis. It is hoped that vaccines for malaria will soon 
prove successful. However, many problems still face immunology research in

"Rapid on-site tests for the analysis of drugs of abuse in unconventional 
specimens (e.g., sweat) have recently been developed. Two healthy volunteers 
familiar with the effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) were given 100 
mg of the drug as a single oral dose. MDMA and its main metabolite 
4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) were determined in plasma and urine by 
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MDMA was also investigated in 
sweat with the Drugwipe (an immunochemical strip test). Subjects' armpits were 
swabbed for 10 s at 0 time (predose) and at 2, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after MDMA 
administration. MDMA consumption could be detected using Drugwipe at 2 h and for 
as long as 12 h after drug administration. However, in one of the volunteers, a 
faint color change appeared at 0 time, when plasma and urine tested negative for 
MDMA and did not disappear even 48 h later. Plasma concentrations of MDMA and 
HMMA measured by GC-MS peaked at 2-4 h, and values greater than 20 ng/mL for 
MDMA and of 40 ng/mL for HMMA were still detected at 24 h. Urine tested positive 
by GC-MS for MDMA and HMMA in the 48-h collection period. These findings 
preliminarily support sweat testing with Drugwipe for monitoring MDMA use."

"BACKGROUND: Potent allergens such as hymenoptera venoms are capable of inducing 
severe and life threatening clinical reactions. Percentage of false negative 
results obtained by the usual diagnostical methods is comprised between 10 and 
25%.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the sensitivity and the specificity of cellular tests 
and particularly evaluation of a new flow cytometric method.
METHODS: Forty-five allergic patients having experienced a local, a systemic 
reaction or an anaphylactic shock and 10 controls having undergone hymenoptera 
stings without clinical reactions were selected on the basis of the clinical 
history, skin tests and specific IgE. Three cellular tests were performed on the 
same cell suspensions and in the presence of 2 ng/mL of rIL3: histamine release 
(RIA), leukotriene C4 release (ELISA) and basophil activation test (flow 
cytometry after double anti-IgE FITC, anti-CD63 PE labelling).
RESULTS: As compared to the clinical history, sensitivities of skin tests, 
specific IgE, flow cytometry, histamine release and leukotriene release were, 
respectively; 85%, 88%, 100%, 89% and 100%. Flow cytometric analysis of basophil 
activation showed a significant decrease of the mean fluorescence density and 
number of IgE positive cells and a significant increase of the number of CD63 
positive cells. The 10 controls tested by flow cytometry were negative.
CONCLUSION: As compared to the clinical history and to the other parameters 
tested here, flow cytometry showed a high sensitivity and a high specificity. 
The excellent correlation observed between this method and the other cellular 
tests such as histamine and leukotriene release are in favour of the specificity 
of flow cytomery and in favour of the use of this method for venom allergy 
diagnosis."

"BACKGROUND: HemoccultSENSA (HOS), the sensitive guaiac fecal occult blood test 
(FOBT) for colorectal neoplasia, is faulted for its low specificity, which might 
be improved by substituting or adding FlexSure OBT (FS), the immunochemical test 
for human hemoglobin. (Both tests are manufactured by Beckman-Coulter Inc., 
Primary Care Diagnostics, Palo Alto, CA.) The authors compared both FOBTs in an 
endoscopic study to determine which FOBT to recommend for a population-screening 
program.
METHODS: Both FOBTs, without dietary restrictions, were prepared by 1410 
screenees or nonbleeding symptomatic patients (3%). All underwent colonoscopy 
(51.8%) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (if asymptomatic and both FOBTs were 
negative).
RESULTS: HOS sensitivity for significant neoplasia, cancers, or adenomas >/= 1 
cm (20 cases) was similar to that of FS (50% vs. 35%, not significant). However, 
HOS specificity was lower (95% vs. 99%, confidence interval (CIs) 94-96 vs. 
98-99, P < 0.05). In those 11 cases in which both HOS and FS were positive, 
specificity for significant neoplasia was 100% but sensitivity decreased to 25% 
(less than HOS alone, P < 0.05). HOS was more sensitive than FS for any 
neoplasia (55 cases), including adenomas < 1 cm (35% vs. 18%, CIs 22-47 vs. 
8-28, P < 0.05), but less specific (96% vs. 99%, CIs 95-97 vs. 98-100, P < 
0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Guaiac HOS, which does not require dietary restrictions, is 
significantly more sensitive for any colorectal neoplasm than the immunochemical 
FS; it identifies more adenomas with a specificity that is low but acceptable 
for population screening."

"In this study TIBC and serum-transferrin concentrations were determined by 
immunochemical turbidimetry, immunochemical nephelometry and radial 
immunodiffusion under normal and pathological clinical conditions. A total of 
246 (123 male/123 female) patients were included [iron deficiency: 60 (18/42), 
iron overload: 56 (39/17), chronic inflammation: 47 (23/24), undefined diseases: 
35 (16/19), healthy volunteers 48 (27/21)]. The data show that determination of 
TIBC from conversion of transferrin values using a constant factor results in 
significantly higher values compared to conversion with a function of first 
degree. For clinical practice the influence of different diseases is negligible. 
This study indicates that it is not possible to develop a universal algorithm

"A new method for in vitro chemosensitivity testing of human lymphoma and 
leukemia patients has been developed. The method is based on the use of 
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a universal marker of proliferation, which is 
expressed early during the cell cycle and has a short half-life. This marker was 
detected by a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, using an ODC antibody 
and a FITC-linked second antibody. The in vitro chemosensitivity of lymphocytes 
from four normal individuals was tested by the immunohistochemical method. 
Lymphocytes from 25 cancer patients were also examined. In drug-sensitive cells, 
the intensity of the marker declined in the presence of the drug, whereas 
resistance to the drug was demonstrated by the presence of the marker. A good 
correlation was found between the predicted chemosensitivity and the outcome of 
the therapy. It has been suggested that this approach could be used for in vitro 
chemosensitivity testing of hematological cancers and most likely also for other 
malignancies."

"The effect of multiple oral doses of montelukast, a cysLT1 receptor antagonist, 
on the pharmacokinetics of oral digoxin was studied in healthy male volunteers 
in a randomized double-blind two-period crossover study. Subjects received 10 mg 
of montelukast or placebo daily for 11 days. On day 7, they received a single 
0.5 mg oral dose of digoxin elixir. The pharmacokinetic parameters of digoxin 
(AUC0-->24' AUC0-->infinity' Cmax' tmax' t1/2) and cumulative urinary excretion 
over 120 hours were not affected by the multiple doses of montelukast. The 90% 
confidence interval for each of these parameters fell within prespecified 
clinically acceptable bounds. Side effects were mild and transient. This 
suggests that concurrent administration of montelukast and digoxin was well 
tolerated. Concurrent treatment with montelukast has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin."

"Tissue injury results in the release of the intracellular protein actin which is 
cleared from the circulation by the plasma proteins gelsolin and Gc-globulin, 
constituting the Extracellular Actin Scavenger System (EASS). Experimental 
studies have shown that excessive amounts of actin in the circulation can lead 
to a condition resembling multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and we 
have previously demonstrated that the level of Gc-globulin is decreased after 
severe trauma. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the 
plasma levels of gelsolin were altered in the early phase after trauma. 
Twenty-three consecutive trauma patients were studied. Plasma samples were 
assayed for gelsolin by immunonephelometry with polyclonal rabbit antihuman 
gelsolin prepared in our own laboratory. The median time from injury until the 
time the first blood sample was taken was 52 min (range 20-110) and the median 
Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 20 (range 4-50). The gelsolin level on admission 
was reduced significantly in the trauma patients compared with normal controls. 
The median level was 51 mg/L (7-967) vs. 207 mg/L (151-621), P < 0.0001. There 
was no correlation between admission levels of gelsolin and ISS or survival. 
This study illustrates that the plasma concentration of gelsolin is 
significantly diminished immediately after traumatic injury. Further studies are 
necessary to establish a role for gelsolin or EASS in the development of MODS in 
trauma patients. The level of serum or plasma gelsolin can be determined rapidly 
and accurately using a nephelometric assay."

"Adhesion molecules, such as Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), play an 
important role during the autoimmune process of Graves' disease (GD). So the 
objective of the study was to evaluate the time-course of the soluble ICAM-1 
(sICAM-1) in GD. Concentrations of sICAM-1, thyroid hormones and TSAb 
(thyroid-stimulating antibodies) were determined in sera from 30 healthy 
controls, 41 untreated GD patients and after 3, 6, 12, 18 months of carbimazole 
therapy (no.=30), at relapse (no.=11) or 2 years after the end of therapy when 
remission (no.=13). Mean sICAM-1 concentration was significantly higher in 
untreated GD patients than in controls (mean+/-SD: 371+/-108 ng/ml vs 243+/-47 
ng/ml, p<0.0001) until 6 months of therapy (289+/-102 ng/ml; NS). The number of 
positive patients (sICAM-1 levels>mean of the controls+2 SD) declined from 56% 
(23/41) at the time of the diagnosis to 10% (3/29) at 18 months. At relapse, 
mean sICAM-1 level significantly increased compared to that at 18 months of 
therapy (288+/-65 vs 236+/-59 ng/ml, p=0.005). At remission mean sICAM-1 level 
was significantly lower than in relapse patients (240+/-48 ng/ml, p=0.04); no 
patient displayed sICAM-1 positive values. In conclusion, sICAM-1 concentrations 
were increased in sera of newly diagnosed GD patients, declined significantly 
during carbimazole therapy and could again be increased at relapse. sICAM-1 
could reflect an ongoing immune process and help to affirm the presence of an 
autoimmunity notably in some cases of TSAb negative patients. However its 
precise interest in clinical practice remains to be determined in further 
studies."

"We explored simultaneously 14-3-3 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and 
one astroglial protein, S-100, recently proposed as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease 
(CJD) markers, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 129 patients with suspected 
CJD. Cutoff values for NSE and S-100 were established at 25 and 2.5 ng/ml, 
respectively. The highest sensitivity was observed for S-100 (94.2%) followed by 
14-3-3 (89.8%) and NSE (79.7%), while the highest specificity in CJD diagnosis 
was obtained with 14-3-3 protein (100%) as compared with NSE (91.5%) and S-100 
(85.4%). No influence of sex, genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene, 
time between sampling, and death or disease duration has been found. Based on 90 
cases initially referred as 'probable' or 'possible' CJD, with 14-3-3, NSE, or 
S-100 we could correctly discriminate between 'CJD' or 'non-CJD' categories in 
94.4, 86.5, and 90% of the cases, respectively. When limited to 'possible CJD' 
cases, diagnosis based on one of the three CSF proteins was accurate in 98, 90.7 
and 87.3%, respectively. In view of the fact that the CSF 14-3-3 protein test 
alone has the highest specificity and good sensitivity, it appears that there is 
no additional advantage at the moment to include NSE and/or S-100 protein in the 
exploration of clinically suspected CJD cases."

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection plays a central role in the 
pathogenesis of mixed cryoglobulinemia through molecular mechanisms which remain 
to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of antibody 
responses to HCV in the pathogenesis of cryoglobulinemia through 
characterization of the anti-HCV specificity and immunochemical characteristics 
of the immunoglobulins involved in cryoprecipitation.
METHODS: Sera from 50 consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection (RNA 
positive) were screened for the presence of cryoglobulins. The two major 
components of cryoprecipitates, IgM rheumatoid factors and IgG, were separated 
by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed for immunochemical 
composition by immunoblotting and antibody specificity by ELISA and 
immunoblotting using recombinant HCV proteins and synthetic peptides as 
antigens.
RESULTS: Cryoprecipitates were observed in 27 patients and characterized by 
immunofixation: 13 (48%) were classified as type II and 14 (52%) as type III. 
Monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected by immunoblotting in 20 
cryoprecipitates: IgM in 14 samples and IgG in 14, with a clear preponderance of 
IgG3 (12/14). Specificity studies on sera and purified IgM and IgG fractions 
from cryoprecipitates revealed enrichment in cryoglobulins, predominantly 
polyclonal IgG1, reactive with the HCV structural proteins, whereas 
specificities for nonstructural viral proteins were relatively less represented 
compared to whole serum. No restricted pattern of fine specificity was observed. 
IgG3 subclass was apparently not involved in HCV nucleoprotein binding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a direct link between monoclonal 
cryoglobulins and immune response to HCV According to the proposed pathogenetic 
model, HCV infection can induce the formation of cryoprecipitable rheumatoid 
factors, sustain their production, and eventually lead to monoclonal B-cell 
expansion through several cooperative mechanisms."

"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between patients' systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) activity and physicians' decision to treat with steroids or 
alternative medication.
METHODS: Baseline information and clinical status was extracted from case 
histories of 30 patients with lupus and represented in clinical vignettes. These 
vignettes were then mailed to 60 physicians (rheumatologists and immunologists 
with experience in the treatment of lupus), asking them in each case whether 
they would initiate treatment or not. The relationship between the 38 complete 
responses and the SLE Activity Measure (SLAM-R) and SLE Disease Activity Index 
(SLEDAI) lupus activity scores was analyzed using a general additive model.
RESULTS: SLE disease activity measured by SLAM-R or SLEDAI is a significant 
predictor (p < 0.0001) of physicians' decision to initiate treatment for 
patients with lupus. Variation between physicians was observed but was mostly 
due to a few outliers. Some other variations remained unexplained by patients' 
SLE disease activity, damage, or by specific organ involvement.
CONCLUSION: We present reference tables and curves for research that may be used 
as a basis to derive standardized quantitative criteria for entry in clinical 
trials. More research is needed on how these tools can be used by clinicians to 
guide them in their decision to treat or not."

"High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (hdIVIg) is increasingly used to treat a 
range of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The current dermatological uses 
of hdIVIg include the treatment of dermatomyositis and the autoimmune bullous 
disorders, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, pemphigoid, and pemphigus. Numerous 
immunomodulatory mechanisms for hdIVIg have been proposed, and they are 
discussed alongside treatment protocols and adverse effects. Increasing use of 
this therapy has helped to establish its excellent safety record, without the 
many adverse effects of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. This safety 
record makes hdIVIg an attractive therapeutic option; however, in view of the 
time required to administer the infusions, the cost, and the urgent need for 
controlled trials of hdIVIg in patients with specific dermatological disorders 
such as pemphigus, patients must be carefully selected. Unfortunately, current 
dermatological uses of hdIVIg have been limited to either uncontrolled trials or 
anecdotal case reports, except for a single controlled trial of hdIVIg as 
adjunctive therapy in patients with dermatomyositis, which documented a 
significant benefit. Further trials in dermatomyositis should be established to 
confirm these data and to clarify the dose and frequency of therapy required for 
patients with dermatomyositis. When using hdIVIg, liaison between the 
dermatologist and the immunologist is helpful because it allows the use of both 
the nursing and the medical expertise of an existing immunotherapy unit. If 
appropriate, the patient may be entered into an hdIVIg home therapy training 
program, such as the one that exists for primary immunodeficiency and some 
neurologic indications, with clear benefits in quality of life and inpatient 
costs."

"Exposure chambers have proven to be valuable tools in studying allergic 
diseases. The chamber provides a controlled environment and maintains conditions 
for measuring the amount of allergen inducing symptoms in allergic subjects. The 
aim of the present study was to develop and test an exposure chamber. The 
chamber was constructed as an airtight tent, made of transparent polyethylene, 
easy to adapt to the shape of an existing room, easy to clean, and providing 
exact allergen-dosage control. Airflow to the interior of the tent was 
controlled by a variable inlet ventilator fitted with a micropore filter and 
balanced by a variable high-volume air-sampler on the outlet side. Trace 
material and allergen were administered as aerosols with a nebulizer connected 
to the inlet pipe. Samples were obtained from interior surfaces and filters at 
the outlet. Two different methods were used to test the concept. One method used 
a colored, neutral trace substance (phenol red indicator) measured 
photometrically on extracts from filters. Secondly, house-dust mite allergen 
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) was applied, with samples analyzed by an ELISA 
technique. The results demonstrated the ability of the system to administer and 
sample allergen with a high degree of reproducibility. A clinical pilot trial

"A monoclonal antibody against 5-methylcytidine was prepared and characterized. 
This antibody, termed AMC, was reactive with compounds that had 5-methylcytosine 
structure (i.e. 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine, 5-methylcytidine and 
5-methylcytosine). AMC had the highest reactivity to 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine 
among reactive compounds and had no or very slight cross-reactivity to 
cytidine-related compounds and any other compounds. Analysis of immunoreactive 
materials in urine revealed that 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine rather than 
5-methylcytidine was, contrary to our expectation, the major component. Then the 
inhibition ELISA system using AMC was established and urinary levels of 
5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine in healthy individuals and cancer patients were 
determined. The mean excretion levels of healthy individuals was 0.90 +/- 0.43 
nmol/mumol creatinine and the cut-off value was set at the mean + 2 S.D. of 
healthy individuals (1.76 nmol/mumol creatinine). Among various types of cancer 
tested, elevated levels of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine were detected in leukemia 
patients. From these results, urinary 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine might be 
applicable as a biologic marker for leukemia."

The role of complement in anti-bacterial defence.
"D'Amelio R(1), Biselli R."
"Author information:
(1)Laboratorio di Immunologia, Aeroporto Pratica di Mare, Roma."
"The complement system consists of several proteins present in human serum 
interacting among themselves and with the other compounds of the immune system 
in the host defence process. In particular, late complement component (C5, C6, 
C7, and C8) deficiencies (LCCD) are closely associated with Neisseria, mainly 
meningitidis, infections. The aim of our study was to verify this association in 
an Italian population by analyzing the complement profile in survivors of 
meningococcal meningitis. Ten out of the 59 (17%) subjects studied had 
homozygous LCCD (6 C8, 3 C7 and 1 C6). The meningococcal C strain was the most 
widely diffused (68%) and had infected all homozygous LCCD subjects. In addition 
meningococcal serogroup C seemed to be the least immunogenic when compared to 
serogroups A and B. These data confirm the close association between homozygous 
LCCD and meningococcal infections from common serogroups (A, B and C) in the 
Italian population. Anti-meningococcal vaccination is usually recommended for 
LCCD subjects because it increases, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the 
antibody component of anti-meningococcal immune defence. We therefore analyzed 
the levels of anti-polysaccharide (PS) A and PSC antibodies in the members of 4 
families including normal subjects and subjects with homozygous and heterozygous 
C7, C8 or factor H defects, before and after vaccination with only PSA+C. 
Surprisingly, we found the highest levels of antibodies before vaccination in 
homozygous subjects, followed by heterozygous and normal controls, whereas, 
after vaccination, homozygous subjects showed the lowest increase of specific 
antibodies, indicating their relative incapacity to respond to meningococcal PS 
alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

"[Nerve growth factor and the state of serotoninergic system in endogenous 
depression and mental retardation]."
[Article in Russian]
"Brusov OS, Lideman RR."
"Platelet parameters of the serotonin system were studied in patients with 
endogenous depressions and children with late documented phenylketonuria (PKU) 
before and after antidepressive therapy. There was a significant decrease in the 
rate of back platelet uptake of 3H-serotonin and an increase in the sensitivity 
of serotonin receptors to serotonin in the patients before therapy and 
normalization of these parameters after therapy. The normalization correlated 
with clinical improvement in patients with endogenous depression. The course 
therapy with L-DOPA and the antidepressant azaphen resulted in a substantial 
mental improvement in children with PKU. There was a significant reduction in 
the ability of platelets from the patients in question to react by releasing 
3H-serotonin in response to nerve growth factor stimulation of cells in vitro."

The effect of grenz rays on irritant skin reactions in man.
"Lindelöf B, Lindberg M."
"To investigate the effect of grenz rays on irritant contact reactions, eleven 
healthy volunteers were studied. They were given 3 Gy of grenz rays, once a week 
for 3 weeks, to a defined area of the back. Twenty-four hours after the last 
treatment, serial dilution sodium lauryl sulphate patch tests were applied both 
on the grenz ray treated area and on the untreated control skin. Biopsy 
specimens were taken from the irritant reactions both from the grenz ray treated 
area and from the control area and different cell populations in dermis and 
epidermis were identified by monoclonal antibodies (Leu 2, 3, 4, 7, Leu M1, B1, 
OKT6). In the grenz ray treated epidermis there was a pronounced reduction of 
OKT6-positive cells but the composition of the dermal cellular infiltrate did 
not differ between control and grenz ray treated skin. The assessment of the 
patch test reactions did reveal a tendency towards weaker reactions in the grenz 
ray pre-treated skin but this difference was not statistically significant. It 
is concluded that grenz rays do not have a marked effect on the elicitation of 
irritant reactions."

Steroid hormone receptors as prognostic indicators in primary breast cancer.
"Thorpe SM, Rose C, Rasmussen BB, King WJ, DeSombre ER, Blough RM, Mouridsen HT, 
Rossing N, Andersen KW."
"Recurrence-free survival (RFS) has been evaluated with regard to estrogen and 
progesterone receptor (ER and PgR) status for 145 postmenopausal women with 
primary breast cancer at high risk for recurrent disease. All patients received 
only local-regional therapy as an adjuvant therapy (DBCG protocol 77-c 
patients). ER+ patients had a significantly longer RFS than ER-patients. This 
difference was apparent using a cut-off level of 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein to 
distinguish between ER+ and ER-patients. There was no apparent difference in 
patients with high (greater than = 100 fmol/mg cytosol protein) ER levels vs. 
those with intermediate (10-99 fmol/mg cytosol protein) levels, indicating that 
the prognostic value of ER determinations in the natural course of the disease 
resides in a qualitative rather than a quantitative distinction among patients. 
No difference in RFS was found patients when patient were subdivided according 
to PgR status. The clinical applicability of the ER-ICA assay method for ER 
determinations is demonstrated in a subset of patients, some of whom received 
adjuvant endocrine therapy."

Cross-allergenicity and immunogenicity of aztreonam.
"Adkinson NF Jr, Saxon A, Spence MR, Swabb EA."
"The immunochemistry of aztreonam, the prototype of the new monobactam class of 
beta-lactam antibiotics, was studied in a series of experimental and clinical 
investigations. Rabbit antibodies to aztreonam and naturally occurring human 
antibodies that recognize aztreonam were found to have negligible 
cross-reactivity with benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, and cefotaxime. Aztreonam 
likewise displayed negligible cross-reactivity (less than or equal to 0.001%) 
with antibodies to penicillin (including human IgE antibodies to major and minor 
penicillin determinants) and to cephalothin. These studies suggest that 
aztreonam may be well tolerated by penicillin-allergic individuals, and this 
possibly is now being evaluated in clinical trials. Seven (6.25%) of 112 healthy 
persons tested had preexisting IgG antibodies to aztreonam in low titer, 
presumably as a result of exposure to naturally occurring cross-reacting 
moieties. Only two of seven patients with preexisting IgG antibodies to 
aztreonam had a rise in titer following aztreonam treatment. No IgE antibody to 
aztreonam was detected in serum specimens obtained on day 10 during any of the 
112 courses of therapy. These clinical observations suggest but do not prove 
that aztreonam has only weak potential to elicit a drug-specific immunologic 
response."

[Pharmacological aspects of immunostimulants].
[Article in German]
"Eichelberg D, Schmutzler W."
"Immunostimulants are chemical substances capable of increasing the overall 
activity of a normal immune system as well as normalizing the function of an 
impaired immune system (immune restauration). This review is concerned with 
substances of microbial or chemical origin and excludes the so-called 
physiological inductors or regulators, e.g. thymic factors, interferon etc. 
During the last decade considerable progress has been achieved with respect to 
the isolation of effective compounds and the elucidation of their chemical 
structure. However, the knowledge of their mechanism of action and their effects 
in the living organism is still poor because of the complexity of the immune 
system, lack of appropriate standardization methods, lack of internationally 
agreed test conditions or diseases in intact animals or conditions for 
controlled clinical trials in man."
